T
he Centre is open
to discussing all is-
sues of national im-
portance, including Opera-
tion
Sindoor,
in
Parliament, Parliamentary
Afairs Minister Kiren Rijiju
said here on Sunday.
The government said
this at an all-party meeting
held ahead of the Monsoon
Session beginning on Mon-
day. At the same time, it
cautioned the Opposition
that any debate on the sub-
ject had to be held within
the laid-down rules and
procedures.
Opposition
parties,
meanwhile, insisted that
Prime Minister Narendra
Modi speak on Operation
Sindoor and U.S. President
Donald Trump’s repeated
claims that he had bro-
kered peace between India
and Pakistan. They de-
manded a discussion on
the ongoing special inten-
sive revision (SIR) of electo-
ral rolls in Bihar.
“We are very open to a
discussion on important is-
sues like Operation Sin-
door. These are issues of
great national importance.
The government is not shy-
ing away and will never shy
away, but is open to discus-
sions within rules, conven-
tions,” Mr. Rijiju told press-
persons after the all-party
meeting.
The Minister empha-
sised that “niyam (rules)”
and “parampara (conven-
tions)” are important for
the government.

China is prepared to dis-
cuss “refning border man-
agement
and
control
rules” to resolve issues
around its disputed boun-
dary with India after the
four-year military stand-of
ended at the Line of Actual
Control (LAC), Chinese
Ambassador to India Xu
Feihong said on Sunday.
He expressed optimism
that the revival of the Kai-
lash Manasarovar Yatra
would “inject impetus” to
ties and that direct fights
would be launched soon.
Rejecting criticism of
China’s support to Pakistan
during Operation Sindoor,
Mr. Xu said that bilateral
ties were not targeted at a
third country. He warned
that comments by Parlia-
mentary Afairs Minister
Kiren Rijiju and other In-
dian ofcials supporting
the Dalai Lama’s statement
on his successor could
cause friction within India-
China bilateral ties.
In written responses to
questions posed by The
Hindu, the Mr. Xu pointed
to a furry of high-level vi-
sits from India to Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation
(SCO) meetings over the
past month as proof of im-
proving ties. They include
visits by Defence Minister
Rajnath Singh, National Se-
curity Adviser Ajit Doval,
and External Afairs Minis-
ter S. Jaishankar. Mr. Xu
noted the possibility of
Prime Minister Narendra
Modi travelling to China for
the SCO Summit on August
31 and September 1, which
would be his frst visit since
the Galwan clashes.

A
fter a three-year
gap, Delhi Universi-
ty (DU) on Sunday
released the detailed cut-
of scores across categories
for each of its 1,528 course-
college combinations, a
move aimed at restoring
transparency in the under-
graduate
admission
process.
The cut-ofs, which are
based on the Common Un-
iversity
Entrance
Test
(CUET) scores, range from
a high of 950 marks out of
1,000 to as low as 65, high-
lighting the sharp variation
in demand across pro-
grammes and institutions.
The 89-page document,
now available on DU’s web-
site, marks a shift from the
past three years.
The university stopped
publicly disclosing this da-
ta after the CUET replaced
board exam-based admis-
sions. Since then, students
could only view cut-ofs for
courses on their prefe-
rence list via the Common
Seat
Allocation
System
dashboard. This meant the
overall cut-of trends re-
mained out of reach for
most students. However,
following repeated requests
from student groups for a
“more open and transpa-
rent system”, the university
has made the complete list
public once again.
While this data won’t im-
pact students currently in
the admission process as
preferences can no longer
be changed, it is expected
to serve as a useful refe-
rence point for future
applicants.
Marks matrix
Among the highest cut-ofs
were those for top-ranked
colleges such as Hindu Col-
lege, St. Stephen’s, Miran-
da House, Lady Shri Ram
College, and Shri Ram Col-
lege of Commerce. Hindu
College had the highest re-
corded cut-of at 950 (out
of 1,000) for BA (Honours)
Political Science, followed
by 936 for its BA pro-
gramme in History and
Political Science.
The CUET scores are not
uniform in total marks
across all subjects. “There
are two types of scores.
Programmes that require
marks in four subjects,
such as Humanities, Com-
puter Science, and Mathe-
matics are scored out of
1,000. Others, such as Bo-
tany, Zoology, Electronics,
and Physics require three
subjects and are scored out
of 750,” a university ofcial
explained.
Some
language
pro-
grammes had signifcantly
lower cut-ofs. The BA
(Hons.) Hindi course at Ma-
ta Sundari College for Wo-
men had a cut-of of just
65, while Zakir Hussain
Delhi College’s BA (Hons.)
Urdu had a cut-of of 111.
This year, DU received
2.39 lakh completed appli-
cations in the second
phase of admissions for
71,642 seats across 79 un-
dergraduate programmes
in 69 colleges and depart-
ments. On Saturday, the
university made 93,166
allocations.
North dominance
The highest number of ap-
plicants came from Delhi
(77,900), followed by Uttar
Pradesh (54,278), Haryana
(24,206),
and
Bihar
(17,173), a DU ofcial said.
Together, these four States
accounted for 72% of the
total applications.
While
some
faculty
members have expressed
concerns over limited re-
gional “diversity” in class-
rooms, a university ofcial
said the applicant pool
does refect national repre-
sentation. The lowest num-
ber of applications came
from Goa (48), the Anda-
man and Nicobar Islands
(61), and Mizoram (65).
As per DU’s schedule,
candidates can accept allo-
cated seats until July 21.
Colleges must approve and
verify applications by July
22, and the deadline for fee
payment is July 23.
DU puts out cut-of scores; Hindu
College sets highest benchmark
DU said the full cut-of list was made public to meet long-standing
transparency demands from student groups. SUSHIL KUMAR VERMA
Varsity releases detailed list for UG courses after 3-year gap; 2.39 lakh students apply for over 71,500 seats in second phase
of admissions; cut-ofs not uniform across programmes; highest number of applicants from Delhi, U.P., Haryana, and Bihar

DEATH ANNIVERSARIES
An Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor, Joginder
Singh alias Bunty, was among seven persons
arrested under the Gambling Act in connection
with an illegal betting racket that was busted at
Swaroop Nagar in north Delhi, a police ofcer
said on Sunday. A probe is on to determine his
involvement in the racket, the ofcer said. Mr.
Singh arrest triggered a war of words between
AAP and the ruling BJP, with Delhi BJP president
Virendra Sachdeva asking why the Opposition
party has not yet expelled the councillor. He
alleged that Mr. Singh had also “brandished a
revolver” during the 2022 municipal election
campaign. In response, AAP alleged that the BJP
government has been using probe agencies to
register “false cases” against its adversaries. PTI
AAP councillor among seven
arrested under Gambling Act
The Bharatiya Janata Party
government in Delhi has
pushed for the implemen-
tation of the National Edu-
cation Policy, 2020, which
emphasises the study of In-
dian knowledge systems
(IKS) in schools.
This has led to the State
Council of Educational Re-
search
and
Training
(SCERT), Delhi, to become
“more focused” on train-
ing its B.Ed. students on in-
tegrating IKS into their les-
son plans, said Professor
Abha Sharma, Principal,
SCERT’s B.Ed. Division.
“We had been trying to
integrate it [IKS training in
the two-year B.Ed. pro-
gramme] for the past cou-
ple of years. But it became
possible only after a push
by the new government in
Delhi to implement the
NEP,” Prof. Sharma told
The Hindu.
She added that the train-
ing is aimed at teaching
“things that are not neces-
sarily taught in books, in
an attempt to create global
teachers with 21st-century
skills”. As an example, she
cites a popular claim in In-
dia, “We have always been
taught that the Wright
brothers few the frst air-
craft. But the frst aircraft
was actually fown in India
by Bapuji Talpade in Mum-
bai in 1895, eight years be-
fore the Wright brothers.”
As part of the IKS train-
ing, the B.Ed. students are
also being taught about
how Sushruta performed
an eye surgery as far back
as the 6th century and how
certain chemicals are men-
tion in the Hindu epic, the
Mahabharata. The bud-
ding teachers are expected
to use their training while
teachingto help “students
learn more about India’s
culture”.
Prof. Sharma said that
they began placing a grea-
ter emphasis on IKS train-
ing for the 2023-2025
batch, which graduated re-
cently. “We will now do it
more comprehensively for
the newer batches. The
students will be trained on
how to make their pedago-
gy plans using the pancha
kosha philosophy,” she ad-
ded. The concept of ‘pan-
cha kosha (fve layers)’ of
consciousness has its ori-
gins in the Upanishads.
The NEP, which aims to
integrate IKS in all levels of
education, states, “The
rich heritage of ancient
and eternal Indian know-
ledge and thought has
been a guiding light for this
policy. The pursuit of
knowledge (jnan), wisdom
(pragya), and truth (satya)
was always considered in
Indian thought and philo-
sophy as the highest hu-
man goal.”
‘Will use it in school’
Koushiki Chatterjee, who
specialises in chemistry
and was part of the B.Ed.
batch that just passed out
said, “In the Mahabharata,
Arjuna used certain chemi-
cals as make-up to disguise
himself as a woman. While
teaching chemistry during
an internship, I mentioned
it to my students.”
Deepali, a B.Ed student
who will be teaching at a
school in August as part of
her
internship,
said,
“While teaching chemis-
try, I can teach students
about the states of matter,
and how ice melts, while
touching upon the concept
of annamaya kosha (the
outer physical layer of the
body, which is one of pan-
cha koshas).” “Pranamaya
kosha (energy layer) comes
into play when I am teach-
ing students about how li-
quid changes to gas, as
there is a transfer of ener-
gy,” she added. Similarly,
Ms. Deepali said she will
employ the concept of
anandamaya kosha (the
spiritual level) when asking
students “to refect on
where they see chemistry
in their daily lives”.

Just past the vibrant felds,
at the edge of the jungle in
Chargaon village, a silence
hangs in the air — not of
peace, but of memory. On
May 10, Vandana Gazbhi-
ye, 50, a daily wage earner,
had been resting after col-
lecting tendu patta (Indian
ebony leaves) near Maha-
rashtra’s Sindewahi forest
area, around 3 kilometres
from her village in Chan-
drapur district. It was 9.30
a.m. and the rain had thick-
ened the undergrowth.
Suddenly, a tiger sprang
out at her. “I still can’t get
over it; I could have died,”
says Gazbhiye, who wears
a scarf to hide her bald-
ness. The injury from the
tiger attack had led to her
shaving the rest of her hair
of. “I am afraid to step out
now,” she adds. Chargaon
is in the Brahmapuri divi-
sion in the Chandrapur for-
est circle. It is closed for
tourists, but frequented by
tigers.
The Chandrapur forest
circle, spanning over 4,081
sq km, is home to 347 tig-
ers, up from 191 in 2020, as
per Chandrapur circle For-
est
Department
data.
Across Chandrapur, 166 vil-
lages are marked vulnera-
ble by the department,
across three forest divi-
sions: Bramhapuri, Central
Chanda, and Chandrapur.
Another 106 are in the Ta-
doba Andhari Tiger Re-
serve (TATR), part of the
Chandrapur forest circle,
with one village in the core
area and the rest in the
bufer. In these areas, peo-
ple have lived in fear of be-
ing attacked over the past
three to four years.
A month after the at-
tack, Gazbhiye is still in
pain and gets headaches.
“I wish I never had to go in-
to the jungle but poverty
forces you,” she says, ad-
ding that she survived only
because one of the tiger’s
claws ripped into the tendu
leaves she was carrying on
her back.
Cramped habitats
Biologist Rakesh Arora,
who works at the TATR,
says a male tiger requires a
minimum home range of
40 sq km; today, at least
four
tigers
share
that
space. The forest area has
remained the same but it
has been fragmented by
urbanisation:
highways
and expanding villages
have cut of tigers from
prey. Farmers, tendu leaf
and mahua collectors, gu-
rakhi (shepherd communi-
ty) and those working for
the
Forest
Department
within the jungle, are the
most impacted by human-
wildlife confict.
In the frst six months of
2025, up to 22 people have
lost their lives, and 183 pe-
ople have been injured in
human-wildlife confict as
per the Forest Depart-
ment. In 2024, they say 27
people died and 165 people
were injured, while in the
past four and a half years,
929 people have been in-
jured and 184 died.
On the same day that
Gazbhiye was attacked,
three women from Mend-
ha (Mal) village, 4 km from
Chargaon, were killed in
an attack by the same tiger,
later identifed as T-81, as
per the Forest Depart-
ment. One of the deceased
is Sarika Shende. Her son,
Dheeraj Shende, 25, says,
“We are living with tigers
like people live with dogs.
They are everywhere. I saw
a tiger this morning.” At Sa-
rika’s house in Mendha
(Mal), where her photo is
hung on the pink wall, her
younger son, Atish Shinde,
22, says he could see multi-
ple pugmarks in the area
his mother was killed.
The ofcials document-
ed the incident after attack
and set up a committee for
approval to trap T-81 and
her cubs, who were then
caught and sent to the Go-
rewada zoo in Nagpur,
about 140 km away. “Tigers
involved in confict end up
in the zoo as no reserve or
national
park
accepts
them,” says veterinary of-
fcer (Wildlife) and head of
Rapid Rescue Team, Dr.
Ravikant S. Khobragade.
“A tigress kills for the pro-
tection of herself and her
cubs rather than attacking
humans. However, she is
aggressive, and her cubs
are naive and curious,” he
adds.
In the last 12 years, the
Forest Department has
captured 94 tigers, with 41
found in confict situa-
tions. Among them, 17 are
females, 11 are sub-adults,
and the rest are male tig-
ers. “Only 36 among the 94
were shifted to the wild,
while 58 ended up in the
zoo,” as per the study con-
ducted by Khobragade.
Mendha
(Mal)’s
sar-
panch, Shradha Gurnule,
26, has been raising con-
cerns around these inci-
dents with the Forest De-
partment. She has asked
for guards to go along with
the tendu plucker group.
Gurnule recollects, “Des-
pite its proximity to the for-
est, tigers used to be a rare
sight in the village until a
couple of years ago. For
the frst time, someone
was
attacked
in
this
village.”
Somewhere
between
Chargaon
and
Mendha
(Mal) in Sindewahi block,
on the side of the main
road, idols of tigers are in-
stalled under thatched ca-
nopies. They depict the lo-
cal ritual practised after
people’s relatives die in a
tiger attack. There are
three idols for Sarika, who
was 50 when she died, and
her friends. This ritual is
sometimes observed so
that the deceased rest in
peace. “This is for the
peace of the village as
well,” says Sarika’s son
Dheeraj.
Many
believe
death by a tiger has to do
with a person’s previous
life.
Chandrapur Chief Con-
servator of Forests, Mani-
kanda Ramanujam says,
“The Forest Department is
working on a war footing
to prevent human-wildlife
confict. We are interacting
with gram sabhas to create
awareness, taking initia-
tives to reduce the depen-
dence of villagers on the
forest, and using technolo-
gy to monitor the move-
ments of tigers in sensitive
villages.”
A forest ofcer in Chan-
drapur says that in fve
years the confict is only
going to increase if appro-
priate steps are not taken.
“Earlier, attacks used to
happen mostly in the sum-
mer, but now they have ex-
tended to the entire year,”
the ofcer says. Currently,
the Brahmapuri division
hosts the highest number
of cubs at 67; sub-adults at
16; and females at 39.
Forest Department ofc-
ers believe most of the at-
tacks are by female tigers
and their sub-adults (bet-
ween 1.5 and 2.5 years),
who are pushed to live on
the borders of the forest
due to territorial fghts,
mostly among males, but
sometime among females
too.
“The problem lies in the
bufer zone (of TATR) and
territorial area (Chandra-
pur’s three zones not a
part of TATR), where food
is low and competition
among tigers is high be-
cause of urbanisation and
land fragmentation,” says
Suresh Chopane, president
at Green Planet Society, a
non-proft
organisation,
promotes environmental
awareness. He is also a
former member of the Re-
gional Empowered Com-
mittee of the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and
Climate
Change,
and
served on the Tadoba Tiger
Conservation Plan.
The Forest Department
says it has installed 982
camera traps across the
circle for surveillance, and
real-time monitoring is car-
ried out using stealth cam-
eras to alert villagers. They
also say they have 181 Prim-
ary Response Teams with
917 members, while joint
patrols are conducted to
prevent tigers and wildlife
from getting electrocuted.
“We are also notifying vil-
lagers of the locations
where there are frequent
movements of tigers,” says
Kushagra Pathak, a forest
ofcer in charge of TATR
(Bufer).
Tiger tourism
In TATR, around 3.5 to 4
lakh people visit Tadoba
every month, says the For-
est Department. Although
tiger tourism generates lo-
cal jobs, it also has a nega-
tive impact on locals, as ex-
cessive
tourism
can
disrupt the natural beha-
viour of tigers.
Former member of the
State Board of Wildlife, Ya-
dav Tarte Patil, says, “Tig-
ers have become used to
people. If a tigress with
four cubs sees hundreds of
humans, the fear vanishes.
Fear is one of the key ele-
ments for coexistence.”

A
head of the Bihar
Assembly election,
Leader of the Op-
position Tejashwi Yadav
has written to 35 promi-
nent leaders, both from
the ruling and Opposition
parties, seeking their sup-
port against the Election
Commission’s (EC) special
intensive revision (SIR) of
electoral rolls in the State.
The RJD leader, who
posted a copy of the letter
on X on Sunday, alleged
that the ongoing exercise
was resulting in large-scale
disenfranchisement.
Mr. Yadav has written to
leaders such as Bihar CM
Nitish Kumar, Lok Janshak-
ti Party (LJP) president Chi-
rag Paswan, Hindustani
Awam Morcha (Secular)
founder Jitan Ram Manjhi,
Telugu Desam Party chief
and Andhra Pradesh CM N.

Jharkhand Students Union
president Sudhesh Mahto,
Apna Dal (Soneylal) chief
Anupriya Patel, Leader of
the Opposition in the Lok
Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and
CPI(ML) general secretary
Dipankar Bhattacharya.
‘Deep sense of anguish’
The RJD leader stated in
the letter that he was writ-
ing with a deep sense of an-
guish and urgency. “The
farce and tragedy of the on-
going SIR in Bihar is shak-
ing the very foundation of
democracy through large-
scale disenfranchisement.
It is a clear indication of
how the ‘independent in-
stitution’ of the EC is ada-
mant on eroding public
trust in the integrity of our
poll process,” it stated.
Mr. Yadav further wrote
that every person in this
country, irrespective of
their background or status,
is proud of their right to
vote and their ability to
participate in the gover-
nance of the country is
deeply empowering. Ex-
pressing apprehension ov-
er the SIR, he said now
lakhs of voters, for no fault
of theirs, are being disem-
powered and humiliated.
“According to the EC’s
press notes dated July 16,
2025, around 4.5% of the
population is already out
in the name of ‘electors not
found at their addresses’.
This is in addition to the
4% who have ‘probably’
died or permanently shift-
ed. Going by these num-
bers, journalists on the
ground and political scien-
tists, who are closely ob-
serving the exercise, peg
the disenfranchisement at
a whopping 12% to 15%.
This is unprecedented in
the history of our country,”
the letter stated.
Mr. Yadav said he is
waiting to receive a “good-
faith and substantive res-
ponse” from the EC. “This
[exercise] needs to be re-
sisted in the strongest
terms. If we do not raise
our voices now, the same
will be carried out in other
States as well. The Consti-
tution demands that we
defend the republic. We
should not be found want-
ing at this historical junc-
ture,” the letter stated.

turned
whistle-blower,
claiming to have buried
multiple bodies of people
allegedly “raped and mur-

over the past several years.
An FIR was registered
based on the complaint
and his statement was re-

Special

da on Sunday sent YSR
Congress Party leader and
Rajampet MP P.V. Midhun
Reddy to judicial remand
till August 1 in the alleged
multi-crore liquor scam
case.
Following the order, the
Special Investigation Team
(SIT) personnel began the
process of shifting Mr. Mid-
hun Reddy to the Rajama-
hendravaram Central Pri-
son amid tight security.
Bail plea rejected
With the Andhra Pradesh
High Court and later the
Supreme Court rejecting
Mr. Midhun Reddy’s antici-
patory bail plea in the case,
the YSRCP leader, who was
named accused no. 4, had
visited the SIT ofce here
on
Saturday
for
questioning.
After about seven hours
of questioning, the SIT had
announced his arrest. On
Sunday, after medical ex-
amination at the Govern-
ment General Hospital in
Vijayawada, Mr. Midhun
Reddy was produced in the
court.
The police have so far
arrested 12 persons in the
alleged ₹3,500-crore liquor
scam, which was commit-
ted during 2019-2024.
YSRCP president Y.S. Ja-
gan Mohan Reddy has con-
demned the “illegal arrest”
of his party leader and MP
in the case.
In a post on X, Mr. Jagan
Mohan Reddy termed it a
“political conspiracy to si-
lence leaders who stand
with the people”.
He said that Mr. Midhun
Reddy, a three-time MP,
was
falsely
implicated
through coerced confes-
sions, and accused the
NDA government of resort-
ing to vendetta to distract
people from its failures
and scams.
Calling the liquor scam a
fabricated narrative de-
signed for media theatrics,
the former Chief Minister
said the case was based on
statements
“extracted
through pressure, threats,
and inducements”.
Case against Naidu
“Chief Minister N. Chan-
drababu Naidu is on bail in
the case pertaining to the
liquor policy framed dur-

Reddy said.
The National Democrat-
ic Alliance government in
the State had revived the
corrupt liquor practices
the YSRCP dispensation
had dismantled, such as
belt shops, illegal outlets,
and prices higher than the
MRP, he alleged.
Alleging corruption in li-
quor licence allotments
and procurement process-
es, he criticised Mr. Naidu
for “using State agencies
and yellow media” to tar-
get Opposition party lead-
ers, while stalling probes
against himself.
“The TDP’s goal is to use
the SIT to jail YSRCP lead-
ers indefnitely, even with-
out trial. But once the trial
begins, the truth will sur-
face,” he observed.
“This is not a legal pro-

hunt,” he added.

Kerala Chief Minister Pina-
rayi Vijayan called on Go-
vernor Rajendra Vishwa-
nath Arlekar at the Raj
Bhavan here on Sunday.
The meeting, which last-
ed an hour, came at a time
when the State’s higher
education sector has been
witnessing deep adminis-
trative turbulence.
A range of pressing is-
sues, primarily centred on
the ongoing crisis involv-
ing various State universi-
ties, including Kerala Un-
iversity, which remains
embroiled in a prolonged
administrative
stand-of,
are learnt to have fgured
in the discussions.
Mr. Vijayan also report-
edly handed over a panel
of nominees for the ap-
pointment of interim Vice-
Chancellor at the Digital
University Kerala. He also
urged the Governor to ex-
pedite the appointment of
an interim Vice-Chancellor
for
APJ
Abdul
Kalam
Technological University.
Pending Bills discussed
The meeting also saw dis-
cussions on several pend-
ing Bills, including the Priv-
ate Universities Bill, which
at present awaits the Go-
vernor’s assent.
The meeting marks the
frst formal interaction bet-
ween the Chief Minister
and the Governor since the
‘Bharat Mata’ controversy
fared up. The row had led
to tensions at Kerala Un-
iversity and the suspension
of Registrar K.S. Anil Ku-
mar by Vice-Chancellor in-
charge Mohanan Kunnum-
mal. However, there is no
ofcial word yet on wheth-
er the issue was raised dur-
ing the conversation.
Mr. Arlekar is under-
stood to have assured the
Chief Minister of his full
cooperation in facilitating
the government’s adminis-
trative initiatives. Mr. Vi-
jayan is also said to have ex-
tended an invitation to the
Governor and his family to
attend the ofcial Onam
celebrations to be hosted
by the government.
Law and Industries Mi-
nister P. Rajeeve, who
spoke to presspersons,
said there was nothing un-
usual about the meeting,
which is an essential com-
ponent of the democratic
governance system.
“Under such a frame-
work, both the govern-

entrusted with undertak-
ing their assigned duties.
Constant interactions are
necessary
to
ensure
smooth coordination,” the
Minister said.

ter R. Bindu recently indi-
cated that the government
had commenced eforts to
restore normalcy in the
functioning of universities
by ironing out diferences.

Editorial
Corrections & Clariﬁcations
The colour labels in the chart, “Dividend surge”, that accompanied the
front page report, “PSU dividends to Centre almost double since 2020”
(July 20, 2025) were reversed.
T
he decision of the U.S. to designate The
Resistance Front (TRF) group that
claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam
terror attack in April 2025, as a Foreign Terrorist
Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated
Global Terrorist is a development that should un-
dergird the global fght against terror. The Minis-
try of External Afairs has called it “a timely and
important step”. For one, the U.S. State Depart-
ment has acknowledged the severity of the Pahal-
gam attack. It also names the TRF as a “front and
proxy” for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which Pa-
kistan claims it has rendered “defunct”. Even
though the U.S. added groups such as the LeT
and the Jaish-e-Mohammad to its FTO list in 2001,
they have masterminded attacks in India since
then. The U.S. has also partially made amends for
the TRF’s name having been kept out of the UN
Security Council (UNSC) resolution condemning
the Pahalgam attack, apparently at Pakistan’s
behest, but with the concurrence of the U.S. and
other P-5 members. It is hoped that the designa-
tion will now help India’s case in designating the
TRF at the UNSC, under the 1267 Committee for
sanctions, also strengthening the trans-national
legal pursuit of those behind the attack.
While this is a positive step, it is necessary to
put the Trump’s administration’s other actions
since the Pahalgam attack into perspective. After
India launched Operation Sindoor, the U.S. has
countered India’s narrative on the four-day con-
fict on several occasions. Mr. Trump, as well as
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have repeatedly
made the claim that the U.S. negotiated the India-
Pakistan ceasefre, and averted a nuclear confict
by using trade ties as leverage — an equivalence
which Pakistan has been happy to endorse. Mr.
Trump’s unprecedented White House lunch and
praise for the Pakistan military chief, Field Mar-
shal Asim Munir, came hours after the govern-
ment had said that Prime Minister Narendra Mo-
di had cleared the picture with Mr. Trump, and
brings into question just how much pressure the
U.S. is willing to put on Pakistan to act against ter-
rorism. The Trump administration had held out
the promise of doing more to support India in its
fght against terrorism by fast-tracking the extra-
dition, in April, of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, who
was wanted by India for the 2008 Mumbai at-
tacks. It is hoped that the TRF’s listing means that
the U.S. is recommitting to that objective. Given
that the real challenge lies more in credibly end-
ing Pakistan’s support to these groups, New Delhi
must focus on its eforts, diplomatic as well as le-
gal, to ensure justice for the victims and to pre-
vent further terrorist acts.
A long list
The designation of TRF as a terror group
should put more pressure on Pakistan
P
resident Donald Trump, under pressure
from a segment of his support base, has
instructed his Attorney General, Pam
Bondi, to request a court to unseal grand jury
transcripts related to sex ofender and former
friend of the President, Jefrey Epstein. While Mr.
Trump had vowed, even during his presidential
campaign, to unveil the fles, in recent days he
has faced mounting pressure to supply all rele-
vant and new information pertaining to the case.
The latest turn in the murky saga relating to Mr.
Trump’s prior association with Epstein, the form-
er fnancier who died by suicide in a New York
prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex traf-
fcking charges, came after a report claimed that
Mr. Trump, in 2003, sent a “bawdy” birthday let-
ter to Epstein with references to a shared “se-
cret”. Mr. Trump has fled a libel lawsuit against
the newspaper and its publisher Rupert Mur-
doch. He went on to post, on the Truth Social
platform, “Based on the ridiculous amount of pu-
blicity given to Jefrey Epstein, I have asked Attor-
ney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all
pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court
approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Demo-
crats, should end, right now!”.
Mr. Trump’s publicity woes regarding Epstein
have been compounded, however, not due to any
action by Democrats, but the fact that far-right
MAGA groups, including conspiracy theorists
such as QAnon, who believe that the U.S. govern-
ment, media, and fnancial worlds are controlled
by elites associated with a global child sex traf-
fcking operation, have been applying pressure
on the administration within Republican circles.
Even prior to the latest report linking Mr. Trump
and Epstein, the President had said that some
“stupid Republicans... have fallen into the net” in
asking for more information to be released. Now,
it is possible that lawmakers in the House of Re-
presentatives will have the opportunity to vote
on the decision to release the documents relating
to the prosecution of Epstein, relying on a legisla-
tive mechanism known as a “discharge petition”.
A bipartisan team, led by Republican Thomas
Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, has proposed
this petition under the moniker of the “Epstein
Files Transparency Act”, which, if it is passed
with 218 signatures, could require the Attorney
General to “make publicly available ... all unclas-
sifed records, documents, communications, and
investigative materials in the possession of the
Department of Justice…” relating to Epstein. Mr.
Trump may soon discover that while it helps his
policy agenda to have a federal government tri-
fecta and a sympathetic Supreme Court, his polit-
ical prospects ultimately rest upon his support
base, and it is one that is capable of abruptly
turning the tide against him.

T
he Aircraft Accident Investigation
Bureau’s preliminary report on the Air
India Boeing 787 air crash in
Ahmedabad, on June 12, 2025, was
released last week, on July 12. The report remains
inconclusive, with critical uncertainties on
whether pilot action was inadvertent or
deliberate. I would argue that the lack of faith
among pilots and those who track aviation like
myself about the robustness of the investigation
and its fndings, — whether correct or not —
emanate from a deep lack of trust in the entire
aviation system in India that often penalises its
personnel, excessively, rather than holding
airlines and regulators to equal scrutiny.
I would like to use this opportunity to, once
again, call for a complete reform in the aviation
sector. A genuine ‘culture of safety’ must
permeate every layer of the aviation system. This
includes fair employment terms and, crucially,
access to mental health care without punitive
consequences resulting in the automatic
grounding of and loss of income for air crew at a
time when the current system, ironically,
jeopardises their psychological well-being.
The complex web of aviation safety is highly
technical, but years of study with aviation
professionals have helped me understand its
intricate technicalities. The aviation system
broadly involves multiple elements: the aircraft
itself (design, airworthiness, and maintenance)
and the people who operate it (maintenance
engineers, technicians, pilots and cabin crew).
These are, broadly, the responsibility of the
airline operator, while airport infrastructure, air
trafc control systems and its personnel are the
responsibility of the Airports Authority of India
(AAI) and/or the aerodrome operator. The
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has
regulatory control over airlines, the AAI and the
airport operators. The Ministry of Civil Aviation
(MoCA) has supervisory control over the DGCA
and the AAI. Aviation accidents never result from
a single failure but stem from multiple failures
that align together, as in the Swiss cheese model.
Each safety layer has faws (holes); when these
holes align across layers, an accident occurs.
The fght for safety through courts
I have fled over 15 Public Interest Litigations (PIL)
in the various High Courts and the Supreme
Court of India after studying the links between
aviation technicalities, regulations and data. I
approached the judiciary because aviation
authorities in charge of safety, became the
violators. No one is held accountable for air
crashes or the lives lost, in turn emboldening
violations despite knowing that existing/known
safety breaches can cause deaths.
Court interventions have saved lives, as seen in
the case of the crash in 2018 at Ghatkopar,
Mumbai, when a small plane fell into a building
site. In 2016, the Bombay High Court had issued a
stay that halted construction near Mumbai
airport. Had it not been issued, a 13-storey
building would have stood in its place at the site..
Mumbai’s airspace is among the most
hazardous globally — there are over 5,000 vertical
obstructions within a four-kilometre radius and in
violation of the Inner Horizontal Surface (IHS)
criteria. Despite a pending PIL, obstacles in the
no-obstacle approach and take-of funnel rose
from 125 in 2010 to over 1,000 in 2025,
highlighting regulatory opacity and potential
misrepresentation by the DGCA, the AAI, airport
operators, and the MoCA before the Bombay
High Court. Had the High Court been informed
about this accurately, the spread of these
obstacles could have been stopped.
Regulatory loopholes that pose a threat
Until 2008, airspace around airports was strictly
regulated. The Aircraft Act and Statutory Order
988 of 1988 enabled the strict control of
construction of buildings around airports. In
2008, a non-statutory committee was formed,
efectively bypassing the legal safeguards that
once ensured obstacle-free zones. It approved 25
buildings in prime locations in Mumbai using an
aeronautical study conducted by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),
which ought not to have been a part of a move to
recommend construction which was illegal and of
extra height. By the time ICAO distanced itself
from the misuse of aeronautical studies, the AAI
had begun conducting its own assessments which
were less stringent.
The appellate committee granted permission
for extra height recklessly. Around the year 2015,
these obstacles, in addition to being physical
barriers to safe fight movements, began
interfering with radar and communication
signals. The appellate committee also came out
with guidelines and capped the maximum height
at 90 metres in the Inner Horizontal Surface (IHS)
and recorded that “any further deterioration in
obstacle profle in and around airport is likely to
aggravate the situation”. Despite this, the
appellate committee allowed obstacles to come
up with impunity jeopardising safe fight
operations. Ironically, the appellate committee
that had permitted the safety violations was given
statutory recognition through the 2015 Rules —
despite these rules not allowing height relaxation.
The panel comprised ofcials entrusted with
aviation safety and included a Joint Secretary in
the Ministry of Civil Aviation, a Joint Director
General in the DGCA, and a Member (Air
Navigation Services) in the AAI. Thus, any
complaint about obstacles is essentially judged by
the very entities that sanctioned them.
Under pressure after a PIL on obstacles, the
MoCA amended the 2015 Rules to limit the no
objection certifcate (NOC) validity to 12 years —
an admission of the issue but an evasion of
responsibility. How does the MoCA justify
approving 100-foor buildings when it knows that
45 foors would become illegal in 12 years? This
raises critical questions. What are the
mechanisms that exist to demolish foors that
become illegal after the expiry of the NOC?
What began in Mumbai has now spread across
India. Even greenfeld airport projects such as
Navi Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Noida (Uttar
Pradesh) have obstacles sprouting around them.
Navi Mumbai Airport will start operations with a
“displaced threshold” — which means aircraft will
be unable to use the full runway because of the
obstacles and increasing risks to air safety,
thereby turning the airport into a monument of
corruption and indiference by aviation
authorities.
There is widespread systemic breakdown.
First, aircraft design and airworthiness. The
DGCA’s limited internal technical capability forces
it to be over reliant on foreign regulators such as
the Federal Aviation Administration (U.S.) and the
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA),
as seen during the engine failure issue (Pratt
&Whitney) that IndiGo experienced in 2017-18.
Second, aircraft maintenance standards.
Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AMEs) work
under severe stress without duty time limits. The
DGCA has allowed airlines to delegate AME tasks
to less-qualifed, lower-paid “technicians” — a
cost-cutting move that undermines safety.
Duty-time limitations recommended for AMEs by
the court of inquiry following the crash in
Mangaluru (May 2010) remain unimplemented.
Third, the fight crew. Airlines violate Flight
Time Duty Limitations for pilots, and the DGCA
grants exemptions which allow pilots who are
fatigued to operate. The DGCA’s unique NOC
requirement restricts pilot mobility across
airlines, increasing stress and enabling airlines to
coerce pilots into breaching regulations. Cabin
crew, whose primary role is passenger safety, are
often dismissed as mere hospitality workers,
which is a dangerously reductive view.
Fourth, airline operations. Airlines prioritise
the goal of proft, adopting policies that
consistently undermine safety. Despite the DGCA
suspending personnel for safety violations, airline
ofcials often retain high positions, controlling
operations. DGCA-appointed ofcers in airlines,
who are expected to enforce compliance, often
have no real authority, making accountability
toothless.
Fifth, air trafc management. The AAI faces a
severe shortage of Air Trafc Controller Ofcers
(ATCO) — an issue that has been fagged even by
parliamentary committees. The provision to give
licences to ATCO has not yet been implemented.
Duty-time limitations for ATCOs — recommended
by the Mangalore Court of Inquiry — remain
unimplemented.
Sixth, silencing whistle-blowers.
Whistle-blowers are often demoted, transferred,
or terminated — a trend that has discouraged the
reporting of critical safety issues in the AAI and
airlines.
When aerodromes operate in violation of
safety standards, any other shortcomings in any
of the other components become potentially fatal
– as seen in Ghatkopar (2018), Kozhikode (2020),
and now Ahmedabad (2025). Non-compliance in
aviation stems from a lack of safety culture, not
ignorance. Crashes are not mere “accidents” —
they are the inevitable result of years of systemic
neglect and policy violations. Without immediate
systemic improvements, the next disaster will not
wait for fve years, but is just around the corner.
The role of the judiciary is important
The judiciary, which has always been the silver
lining in India’s constitutional set-up, has been
inactive on aviation issues, relying on the state’s
technical expertise on the subject. It must
address the deterioration in the aviation sector
and hold authorities accountable. Additionally,
the judiciary’s conservative approach to valuing
human life needs to change.
In India, human life is undervalued, for
example, as seen in railway accidents and motor
vehicle deaths — a few lakhs of rupees. When this
is the worth of a human life, safety upgrades that
cost crores of rupees become easier for
stakeholders to ignore. Immediate and
comprehensive reform is needed. The aviation
system requires accountability, oversight and a
safety-over-proft commitment.
Reform cannot wait. Lives are at stake.
Reform cannot wait, aviation safety is at stake

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Letters emailed to
letters@thehindu.co.in
must carry the postal address.
L
ess than three years ago, ChatGPT dragged
artifcial intelligence (AI) out of research
laboratories and into living rooms,
classrooms and parliaments. Leaders sensed the
shock waves instantly. Despite an already
crowded summit calendar, three global
gatherings on AI followed in quick succession.
When New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit in
February 2026, it can do more than break
attendance records. It can show that
governments, not just corporations, can steer AI
for the public good.
India can bridge the divide
But the geopolitical climate is far from smooth.
War continues in Ukraine. West Asia teeters
between fareups. Trade walls are rising faster
than regulators can respond. Even the Paris AI
Summit (February 2025), meant to unify, ended
in division. The United States and the United
Kingdom rejected the fnal text. China welcomed
it. The very forum meant to protect humanity’s
digital future faces the risk of splintering. India
has the standing and the credibility to bridge
these divides.
India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology began preparations in earnest. In
June, it launched a nationwide consultation
through the MyGov platform. Students,
researchers, startups, and civil society groups
submitted ideas.
The brief was simple: show how AI can
advance inclusive growth, improve development,
and protect the planet. These ideas will shape the
agenda and the fnal declaration. This turned the
consultation into capital and gave India a
democratic edge no previous host has enjoyed.
Here are fve suggestions rooted in India’s digital
experience. They are modest in cost but can be
rich in credibility.
Pledges and report cards
First, measure what matters. India’s digital tools
prove that technology can serve everyone.
Aadhaar provides secure identity to more than a
billion people. The Unifed Payments Interface
(UPI) moves money in seconds. The Summit in
2026 can borrow that spirit. Each delegation
could announce one clear goal to achieve within
12 months. A company might cut its data centre
electricity use. A university could ofer a free AI
course for rural girls. A government might
translate essential health advice into local
languages using AI. All pledges could be listed on
a public website and tracked through a
scoreboard a year later. Report cards are more
interesting than press releases.
Second, bring the global South to the front
row. Half of humanity was missing from the
leaders’ photo session at the frst summit. That
must not happen again. As a leader of the Global
South, India must endeavour to have as wide a
participation as possible.
India should also push for an AI for Billions
Fund, seeded by development banks and Gulf
investors, which could pay for cloud credits,
fellowships and local language datasets. India
could launch a multilingual model challenge for
say 50 underserved languages and award prizes
before the closing dinner. The message is simple:
talent is everywhere, and not just in California or
Beijing.
Third, create a common safety check. Since
the Bletchley Summit in 2023 (or the AI Safety
Summit 2023), experts have urged red teaming
and stress tests. Many national AI safety institutes
have sprung up. But no shared checklist exists.
India could endeavour to broker them into a
Global AI Safety Collaborative which can share
red team scripts, incident logs and stress tests on
any model above an agreed compute line. Our
own institute can post an open evaluation kit
with code and datasets for bias robustness.
Fourth, ofer a usable middle road on rules.
The United States fears heavy regulation. Europe
rolls out its AI Act. China trusts state control.
Most nations want something in between. India
can voice that balance. It can draft a voluntary
frontier AI code of conduct. Base it on the Seoul
pledge but add teeth. Publish external red team
results within 90 days. Disclose compute once it
crosses a line. Provide an accident hotline.
Voluntary yet specifc.
Fifth, avoid fragmentation. Splintered summits
serve no one. The U.S. and China eye each other
across the frontier AI race. New Delhi cannot
erase that tension but can blunt it. The summit
agenda must be broad, inclusive, and focused on
global good.
The path for India
India cannot craft a global AI authority in one
week and should not try. It can stitch together
what exists and make a serious push to share AI
capacity with the global majority. If India can
turn participation into progress, it will not just be
hosting a summit. It will reframe its identity on a
cutting edge issue.

Delhi
Opinion
Moscow, July 20: Soviet space scientists spent
seven clif-hanging minutes during the second
docking operation between Apollo and Soyuz-19
as the two spacecraft buckled and rolled and
even began to rotate, a Soviet space ofcial
revealed to-day.
Dr. Vladimir Syromyatnikov, the head of the
Soviet-American task force which designed and
built the docking mechanism used to join the
two spacecraft during their fight together
through space, said the fnal link-up had taken
place under “extreme conditions”.
The pitching and tossing about of the two
spacecraft between 12:33 and 12:40 GMT had
been “rather unexpected”, he said. Space
controllers watching the action on their
television screens lived through seven
emotion-flled minutes, he added.
He said the fact that all went well in the end
was proof of the ability of the mechanism to
withstand all the shocks to which it was
subjected. “We do not know the exact reasons
for yesterday’s incident and specialists from the
two countries are at work analysing the causes,”
Dr. Syromyatnikov said.
The Soviet expert said it would not have been
“tragic” if the mechanism had buckled during
the docking operation because the astronauts
would have then taken immediate steps to
separate the two spacecraft ready for their
return to earth.
The docking mechanisms were not directly
attached to the space capsules used in the
descent to earth, Dr. Syromyatnikov noted.

contemplated for assimilating the position of
European and British subjects serving in
Provincial Services in India to that of either Civil
Services in respect of the retirement on

no general extension of the right to retirement

A HUNDRED YEARS AGO JULY 21, 1925
Indian provincial services
R
ecently, a political
controversy erupted in
Tamil Nadu on the
issue of diverting
temple funds for building colleges.
Beyond the political debates, the
issue throws light on a unique
social justice model around the
regulation of secular practices
associated with religion. This
model, predominantly developed
in the erstwhile Madras
Presidency, draws strength from a
200-year-old legislative framework
which continues till date. It has
gained more acceptance in south
India. As elections approach in
Kerala and Tamil Nadu, clarity on
the issue will help difuse attempts
to polarise voters around it.
Religious endowments law
Through the Religious
Endowment and Escheats
Regulation 1817, the East India
Company set up the earliest
legislative architecture around
regulation of religious
endowments. When the British
Crown assumed direct control
over Indian territories in 1858,
Queen Victoria issued a
proclamation stating that the
sovereign would restrict
interference in religious afairs.
This was necessary as there was
concern about losing face from the
1857 Sepoy Mutiny, which was
triggered by religious issues.
However, the withdrawal of the
British government from religious
afairs was not complete. In fact,
in the Madras Presidency, various
British ofcials argued for
continued oversight of religious
endowments. Finally, the British
government settled for a balanced
approach: the sovereign would not
interfere with practices that were
essentially religious, such as
rituals, but would exercise control
over the lands and secular aspects
of the religious endowments.
The idea of the government
supervising religious institutions
came to be crystallised when the
Justice Party was elected in 1920.
One of the earliest legislative
interventions by the Justicites was
Bill No. 12 of 1922: Hindu Religious
Endowments Act. When it was
introduced in the Madras
Legislative Council, it faced
opposition, mainly due to the
provision in the law that allowed
surplus temple funds to be
diverted for other purposes.
The nub of the issue was
whether funds provided to a
temple could be used for secular
purposes. The matter was debated
and settled in 1925, when the law
was enacted. Since then, every
revised version of the plenary law,
including the current law — The
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959
— has retained the provision of
surplus funds.
Section 36 of the 1959 Act
permits the trustees of religious
institutions to appropriate any
surplus funds for any purposes
listed under the law, with the prior
sanction of the Commissioner.
‘Surplus’ means any amount
remaining after adequate
provisions have been made for the
maintenance of the temple and
training of its ofcials. The Act also
empowers the Joint Commissioner
or the Deputy Commissioner to
appropriate funds in cases where
the original purpose has become
impossible to fulfl.
Endowments to temples have a
long and rich history. Temples
received lavish donations from the
sovereign rulers from as far back
as in 970 AD, when the Chola
empire was at its peak. Historian
Anirudh Kanisetti writes that
Sembiyan Mahadevi, a Chola
queen, made strategic donations
of land and kind to temples. The
practice continued during the
Vijayanagara kingdom. Temples
were not just places of worship;
they were socio-cultural hubs and
were also used for educational
purposes. This is confrmed by the
inscriptions on temple walls and
the spacious mandapams (pillared
halls) which were used to hold
educational or cultural events. So
the original intent argument
would also support the theory of
utilising temple resources for
educational purposes.
The 1959 Act has been tested
and upheld by constitutional
courts. Among the permissible
uses of surplus funds under the
1959 Act is the establishment and
maintenance of universities or
colleges (Section 66). These
educational institutions are also
required to make available the
study of the Hindu religion or
Hindu temple architecture. Seen
within this framework, building
colleges from temple funds is not
only legal, but a logical extension
of these provisions.
Social justice legacy
The controversy around the use of
temple funds cannot be restricted
to discussing legal propositions,
however; it also carries ideological
and sociopolitical signifcance. In
the pre-colonial era, the
motivation for the rulers to
support large-scale endowments
was that the temples acted as
channels through which state
resources could be allotted for
important welfare projects.
Through colonial rule, the British
East India Company and the
Crown viewed sovereign
involvement in the management
of temple afairs as necessary for
reasons of revenue and
maintenance of local control.
Over the last century, the
Self-Respect Movement, which
emerged from the Madras
Presidency, viewed the regulation
of temples and oversight of their
resources as a critical feature of
anti-caste reforms. Without this,
there would have been no temple
entry legislation in 1936 and 1947.
Today, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are
among the few States where
governments have appointed
priests from backward classes
after a prolonged legal struggle.
Ultimately, any argument
against government control of
temple afairs would be striking at
the root of social justice. The role
of the government in ensuring that
surplus funds are appropriated in
a lawful manner is settled. Any
reversal of this would only result
in a set back of the long legacy of
social justice and religious reforms
that south India has pioneered.

O
ver more than half a
decade, the relation-
ship between the Ker-
ala government and the Raj
Bhavan
has
deteriorated.
Where there was ceremonial
civility and mutual respect
earlier, there is now friction,
partisanship, and constitu-
tional
brinkmanship.
And
caught in this crossfre are Ker-
ala’s public universities.
Successive Governors — Arif
Mohammed Khan followed by
Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar
— have clashed repeatedly
with the CPI(M)-led Left De-
mocratic Front (LDF) govern-
ment, especially over matters
pertaining to higher educa-
tion. Increasingly, these dis-
putes are no longer symbolic
or rhetorical; they are afect-
ing the functioning of academ-
ic institutions.
This dysfunction is most
apparent in the ongoing dea-
dlock over the appointment of
Vice-Chancellors. Thirteen of
the
14
State
universities,
where the Governor serves as
Chancellor, have been without
permanent Vice-Chancellors
for months or even years. The
logjam arises from disagree-
ments between the govern-
ment and the Governor’s of-
fce over the constitution of
search-cum-selection commit-
tees, efectively stalling leader-
ship
appointments
in
institutions.
The current fashpoint of
this crisis is the University of
Kerala. On June 25, a private
event at the university’s Se-
nate Hall was abruptly can-
celled on the grounds that it
featured a controversial depic-
tion of ‘Bharat Mata’ holding a
safron fag. Citing violations
of university norms, Registrar
K.S. Anil Kumar issued orders
to cancel the event, reportedly
at the advice of the Syndicate,
which is dominated by Left-
leaning members. The Gover-
nor was informed of the can-
cellation, but chose to go to
the Senate Hall nevertheless.
The programme proceeded
amid student protests and pol-
itical tensions.
A week later, the Vice-
Chancellor in-charge, Moha-
nan Kunnummal, suspended
the Registrar. In retaliation,
the Syndicate convened a
meeting, and despite the Vice-
Chancellor formally adjourn-
ing and exiting the meeting,
proceeded to revoke the sus-
pension, citing procedural
overreach. The scenario has
given way to an unprecedent-
ed situation where both the
suspended Registrar and his
temporary replacement claim
to hold the same ofce.
As the stand-of persisted,
students bore the brunt. Prot-
ests escalated and essential
administrative processes, in-
cluding the issuance of degree
certifcates, came to a halt. Dr.
Kunnummal returned to the
university only on July 18 and
cleared the backlog, reported-
ly under the Governor’s ad-
vice. Even then, Higher Edu-
cation Minister R. Bindu’s
attempt to broker a truce has
yielded
little
substantive
change. The Vice-Chancellor
remains adamant on the legiti-
macy of the suspension, while
the Syndicate insists on its
revocation.
The Governor and the go-
vernment also continue to
spar over the appointments of
interim
Vice-Chancellors,
with each attempting to assert
their ideological and adminis-
trative primacy in the higher
education sector. While the
Left claims that campuses are
being infuenced by the Rash-
triya
Swayamsevak
Sangh
(RSS), the Governor’s ofce
claims that there is excessive
political interference by the
State. Mr. Arlekar’s ideological
proximity to the RSS and his
public admiration for Hindut-
va ideologue V.D. Savarkar
have only heightened ten-
sions. With little sign of a
thaw, the confrontation threa-
tens to erode public faith in
governance as well as in high-
er education.
The longer this constitu-
tional tug-of-war continues,
the greater the risk of irrepara-
ble harm to not just the repu-
tations of these institutions,
but also to the lives of thou-
sands of students whose aca-
demic and professional fu-
tures are in limbo. The
University of Kerala, the Co-
chin University of Science and
Technology, and the Mahatma
Gandhi University ranked bet-
ween 9th and 11th places
among State public universi-
ties in the NIRF India Rank-
ings 2024. Their progress risks
being undone by continued
administrative paralysis and
the increasing politicisation of
academic governance.
Kerala’s universities de-
serve better. They cannot be
made pawns in an ideological
war; they need autonomy, lea-
dership, and stability. If the
State’s constitutional actors
cannot rise above their en-
trenched positions, the stu-
dents, and the credibility of
Kerala’s academic institutions,
will ultimately have to pay the
price.

STATE OF PLAY
T
he speculation over wheth-
er the BJP will support a
TDP candidate in the up-
coming Jubilee Hills by-poll signals
a broader realignment in Telanga-
na’s political landscape.
The 2023 Assembly elections
marked a rupture in Telangana’s
political trajectory. The decade-
long dominance of the BRS, for-
merly the Telangana Rashtra Sa-
mithi, came to an end as the Con-
gress returned to power under
Revanth Reddy. While the spot-
light has been on the Congress’s
resurgence, it is the unfolding re-
entry of the TDP and the consoli-
dation of the BJP-TDP-JSP alliance
that holds deeper implications for
the political landscape. To assess
what this reshufing portends, it is
essential to revisit the historical
trajectories of vote share transfers,
social base shifts, and evolving pat-
terns of caste and party alignment.
The TDP’s renewed interest in
Telangana is a strategic return
rooted in its historical strength.
From 1985 to 1999, it consistently
won over 45% of seats in the re-
gion, drawing support from Back-
ward Classes (BCs) such as the Ya-
davs, Gouds, Mudirajs, Munnuru
Kapus, and settler Kammas in
southern Telangana. Post-2001,
due to its ambiguous stance on
Statehood, its vote share dropped
from 38.46% in 1999 to 15.32% in
2014, and to 0% in 2023 when it
did not contest.
Correlation analysis of histori-
cal vote shares reveals a strong ne-
gative correlation (-0.89) between
the TDP and the BRS, suggesting
that the BRS’s rise was built sub-
stantially on the crumbling edifce
of the TDP’s support base. This
trend was visible across key dis-
tricts (Table). In Karimnagar, the
TDP’s vote share plummeted from
46.5% (1999) to 0% (2023), while
the BRS’s vote share rose from 0%
to 37.9% over the same period. In
Medak, the TDP’s fall from 47.5%
to 0% coincided with the BRS’s rise
to 45.3%. In each case, the migra-
tion of BC votes and settler votes
from the TDP to the BRS was cru-
cial for the latter’s dominance.
However, the electoral tide be-
gan to turn after 2018. The BRS,
having reached its peak in that
election with a vote share of
47.32%, began to lose ground due
to governance fatigue, internal
fragmentation, and its failed at-
tempt at national expansion. As
dissatisfaction grew, especially
among aspirational BCs and Dalits,
a second wave of vote transfer be-
gan, this time from the BRS to the
BJP. The BJP’s Statewide vote share
increased from 7.10% in 2018 to
13.9% in 2023, marking its best per-
formance in Assembly elections in
the State. Its growth was especially
sharp in northern Telangana: in
Adilabad, the BJP grew from 7.85%
to 27.6%; and in Nizamabad, from
6.88% to 26.2%. Some Scheduled
Tribe (ST) groups in northern Te-
langana, such as the Gonds, have
also extended support to the BJP.
What makes this moment par-
ticularly signifcant is the overlap-
ping social base of the three par-
ties. Each has historically drawn
from the same pool of Backward
Classes, settler Kammas, and sec-
tions of Dalits, especially the Madi-
gas. The BRS’s dominance bet-
ween 2014 and 2018 rested on its
ability to combine Velama leader-
ship with broad BC support. But
with the NDA now consolidating
this fragmented social base, the
TDP is reactivating its settler and
BC networks in urban centres and
the BJP is consolidating Madiga
and
Other
Backward
Classes
(OBCs) support in the north. The
expectation from the JSP is to mo-
bilise Munnur Kapus. The BRS
fnds itself in danger of being
squeezed out from both ends.
While this churn weakens the
BRS, it paradoxically strengthens
the Congress in the short term. In
2023, Congress won because it
successfully positioned itself as the
alternative amid a fractured oppo-
sition. Its vote share rose from
28.65% in 2018 to 39.40% in 2023,
and it gained signifcant traction in
southern districts. These gains
came predominantly from tradi-
tional support among Reddys, Ma-
las, and segments of OBCs disillu-
sioned with the BRS.
The Congress is moving beyond
its traditional Reddy and Mala base
by courting OBCs through a 42%
BC reservation plan and by making
BC leader Mukesh Kumar Goud as
the State Congress chief. Its aim is
to chip away at the OBC support of
the BRS and BJP. This marks a con-
scious attempt to reposition itself
as a platform for backward caste
assertion in Telangana. Yet the
NDA is posing a challenge with a
broad caste alliance that includes
Kammas, Kapus, Madigas and ma-
ny non-dominant OBCs, backed by
the BJP’s cadre strength, the TDP’s
grassroots networks, and the JSP’s
possible appeal among youth and
Munnur Kapus.
Geographically, the NDA has
managed to minimise internal fric-
tion: the BJP consolidates its hold
over northern Telangana and ur-
ban pockets such as Hyderabad
and Warangal, while the TDP is
poised to recover ground in south-
ern districts such as Nalgonda,
Mahbubnagar, and Khammam.
The alliance is thus strategically
distributed.
The real concern for the Con-
gress, then, is not its lack of social

COMPILED BY THE HINDU DATA TEAM
The story so far:
I
n January 2024, South Africa
initiated proceedings against Israel
at the International Court of Justice
(ICJ), alleging that Israel’s military
campaign in Gaza amounted to genocide.
The application was fled just over two
months after the Hamas-led attacks of
October 7, 2023. Although the court has
not yet ruled on the merits of the charge,
it has issued a series of binding
provisional measures, including repeated
directives to ensure the unimpeded
delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
These interim orders refect the court’s
preliminary assessment that a “plausible”
risk of genocide exists. In the months
since, conditions in Gaza have grown
increasingly dire. In March, Israel violated
a six-week ceasefre and resumed its
assault on the besieged enclave. Entire
neighbourhoods have been reduced to
rubble, families decimated, and access to
food, water, and electricity remains
critically limited. As the humanitarian
crisis worsens, a global consensus is
emerging. Heads of state, senior United
Nations ofcials, and leading international
jurists are increasingly characterising
Israel’s conduct in Gaza as genocidal.
What is genocide?
The term genocide was coined in 1944 by
Polish-Jewish jurist Raphael Lemkin and
formally recognised as a crime under
international law by the UN General
Assembly (UNGA) in 1946. In the
aftermath of the horrors of the Holocaust,
the UNGA unanimously adopted the
Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
(Genocide Convention) in 1948. The
Convention defnes genocide as acts
committed with “the intent to destroy, in
whole or in substantial part, a national,
ethnic, racial, or religious group”. It is
considered the gravest of international
crimes, and its prohibition constitutes a
non-derogable peremptory norm (jus
cogens) of international law.
Because of its status as a jus cogens
norm, the duty to prevent and punish
genocide gives rise to an erga omnes
obligation — one owed to the international
community as a whole. This means that
all states, regardless of their direct
involvement in a confict, are legally
bound to act against genocide wherever it
occurs. It is on this basis that South
Africa, a party that is technically
unrelated to the confict in Gaza, claims
standing to bring the case to the ICJ.
Proving that genocide has occurred
requires establishing two essential
elements: the act itself and the intent
behind it. The frst element, known as
actus reus, refers to one or more of fve
specifc acts committed against a
protected group. These include killing
members of the group; causing them
serious bodily or mental harm;
deliberately inficting conditions intended
to bring about the group’s physical
destruction; imposing measures to
prevent births within the group; and
forcibly transferring children to another
group.
Equally critical is the mens rea, or
mental element, which requires not just a
general intent to carry out these acts, but
a specifc intent (dolus specialis) to destroy
the group, in whole or in part. This rare
intent is what sets genocide apart from
other mass atrocities. While other crimes
may involve the indiscriminate or
deliberate killing of civilians as
individuals, genocide is characterised by
the targeting of individuals as members of
a group, with the aim of annihilating the
group’s capacity to survive or reconstitute
itself as a political, social, or cultural
entity.
What are the main claims against
Israel, and how has Israel responded?
Francesca Albanese, the UN Special
Rapporteur on the situation of human
rights in the Palestinian territories, told
the Human Rights Council last year that
there were reasonable grounds to believe
Israel had crossed the threshold for
committing genocide. In her report, she
pointed to the systematic destruction not
only of residential areas but also of critical
infrastructure, including hospitals,
universities, mosques, water systems,
agricultural zones, and cultural heritage
sites, as evidence of a policy aimed at
making Palestinian life in Gaza
unsustainable. Her assessment has been
echoed by prominent rights organisations
such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty
International, and the European Center
for Constitutional and Human Rights.
The scale of destruction appears to
lend further credence to these claims. In
June, a UN Commission of Inquiry found
that Israeli air strikes, shelling, burning
and controlled demolitions had destroyed
more than 90% of schools and university
buildings across the Gaza Strip. According
to local health authorities, over 58,000
people have been killed, including more
than 17,000 children. Gaza now
reportedly has the highest per capita
number of amputee children in the world.
As the starvation crisis deepens, civilians
have reportedly been shot while waiting
in queues for food and essential supplies.
In its submission to the ICJ, South
Africa accused Israel of “weaponising
international humanitarian law” to shield
its actions from accountability. Since the
outset of the genocide proceedings, Israel
has maintained that its military campaign
targets Hamas and not civilians, who it
claims are afected only as collateral
damage. Ms. Albanese has described this
approach as “humanitarian camoufage,”
arguing that Israel has systematically
distorted key humanitarian norms, such
as those on human shields, collateral
damage, safe zones, evacuations, and
medical protection, to blur the distinction
between civilians and combatants. This
strategy, she argues, not only obscures
the real human cost of the confict but
also undermines the core tenets of
international humanitarian law.
Why is proving genocidal intent
difcult?
Establishing genocidal intent is
notoriously difcult, as states rarely
articulate such intent overtly. Accordingly,
the ICJ has held that intent may be
inferred from circumstantial evidence,
such as the scale and nature of atrocities,
patterns of conduct, and dehumanising
rhetoric by state ofcials. In its
submission to the ICJ, South Africa cited
several statements by senior Israeli
leaders as indicative of genocidal
intent. For instance, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that the
enemy would “pay a huge price” and
pledged to reduce parts of Gaza “to
rubble.” Other ofcials have referred to
Palestinians as “human animals” and
called for their “total annihilation.”
However, the ICJ’s evidentiary standard
for proving genocidal intent remains
stringent and has come under increasing
criticism.
In Croatia v. Serbia (2015), the court
held that such intent could only be
inferred from a pattern of conduct if “this
is the only inference that could be
reasonably drawn” from the acts in
question. This rigid standard efectively
precludes a fnding of genocide if any
alternative motive appears plausible. In
2023, several states, including Canada,
the Netherlands, the U.K., Germany,
France, and Denmark, raised concerns
over this high bar in a joint declaration
fled in the genocide case instituted by
Gambia against Myanmar. They cautioned
that such a restrictive approach risks
making genocide “near-impossible” to
prove. Instead, they proposed a
“balanced approach,” urging courts to
weigh all available evidence and discard
inferences that are clearly unreasonable.
In other words, the presence of other
conceivable motives should not
automatically negate a fnding of
genocidal intent.
This view is consistent with
international criminal jurisprudence.
Both the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the
International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR) have recognised that
genocidal intent can coexist with other
motives. In Prosecutor v. Goran Jelisić
(2001), the ICTY held that “the existence
of a personal motive does not preclude
the perpetrator from also having the
specifc intent to commit genocide.”
However, even under the ICJ’s exacting
standard, several experts believe that
Israel’s conduct fulfls the criteria for
genocide.
In November last year, Israeli genocide
scholar Shmuel Lederman acknowledged
that the operational patterns of the Israeli
Defence Forces closely mirrored the
incendiary rhetoric of senior ofcials.
Similarly, Omer Bartov, a professor at
Brown University and former Israeli
soldier, recently wrote in The New York
Times that both ofcial rhetoric and
developments on the ground had led him
to the “inescapable conclusion” that
Israel is committing genocide against the
Palestinians.
What is the road ahead?
A fnal verdict by the ICJ on South Africa’s
genocide allegations against Israel is likely
to take years, as it must follow extensive
hearings on jurisdiction and the merits of
the case. By the time a judgment is
rendered, the devastation in Gaza may
already be irreversible, particularly in
light of Israel’s continued non-compliance
with the court’s binding provisional
measures. As a result, the proceedings are
increasingly being seen as a litmus test for
the credibility of the so-called
“rules-based international order”.
Within the UN framework, a strong
case has emerged for suspending Israel
from the UNGA, citing its persistent
violations of the Charter and binding
Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.
Article 6 of the Charter permits the
expulsion of a member state by the
Assembly on the UNSC’s recommendation
if it consistently breaches the Charter’s
core principles. In 2024, the UNGA
adopted a resolution calling for economic
sanctions on Israel, including an arms
embargo.
Yet, major Western powers, including
France, the U.K., Germany, and Canada,
have confned their responses to muted
diplomatic criticism, particularly
following the collapse of the ceasefre in
Gaza in March. The U.S., in particular, has
continued to shield Israel from
accountability by repeatedly vetoing most
UNSC resolutions demanding an
immediate ceasefre. In the absence of
decisive multilateral action, one can only
hope that President Donald Trump may
once again intervene and nudge Mr.
Netanyahu to agree to a renewed ceasefre
and bring an end to the ongoing
bloodshed.
Is Israel committing genocide in Gaza?
Why did South Africa take Israel to the International Court of Justice? What does international law say about genocide? Do international experts believe Israel
has genocidal intent? Can the UN take stronger action? What role are powerful countries playing?
Tensions rise: Genocide is characterised by the targeting of individuals as members of a group, with the
aim of annihilating the group’s capacity to survive or reconstitute itself. AFP


In January 2024, South Africa
initiated proceedings against
Israel at the ICJ, alleging that
its military campaign in Gaza
amounts to genocide, based on
a plausible risk and supported
by statements from Israeli
leaders and patterns of
destruction.

Establishing genocidal intent is
dificult, as states rarely
express it openly. The ICJ’s
stringent evidentiary standard
has been criticised for making
genocide “near-impossible” to
prove, even when actions and
rhetoric strongly suggest such
intent.

While the ICJ has issued
binding provisional measures,
Israel’s non-compliance and
continued assault raise doubts
about the credibility of the
rules-based international
order. Calls for UN sanctions
grow, but powerful states like
the U.S. continue to block
decisive action.

“Did you fnd the time to watch the
Wimbledon fnals on TV?”
“I watched the men’s match
completely. But when it came to the
ladies fnal, I watched only the frst three
games before switching of the TV.”
“Only three games?”
“It was fairly obvious by then that
Swiatek was going to blow away
Anisimova.”
“Blow away?”
“The expression ‘blow away’ has many
diferent meanings. But in the context of
sports, it is mostly used to mean to defeat
someone comprehensively.”
“In other words, you outperform
everyone else.”
“I guess you could say that. Here’s an
example. After the second round, Iga
Swiatek just blew away her opponents.”
“How about this example? During the
frst half of the game, the two teams were
evenly matched. In the second half,
however, our opponent blew us away by
scoring seven goals.”
“Ouch! Here’s another one. We thought
Sindhu would blow away the competition.
We were shocked when she lost in the
frst round.”
“That’s what makes every tournament
exciting. So, did Sujatha buy you
breakfast? After all, you did take a bet
with her that Swiatek would win.”
“That’s true. But Sujatha is going
through a tough time. So, I’m keeping my
lips zipped about the bet.”
“Does it mean the same thing as
‘keeping your lips buttoned’?”
“Very good. When you keep your lips
zipped, what you are doing is keeping
quiet. The Manager was angry and wasn’t
willing to listen to reason. So, I decided to
keep my lips zipped.”
“Keeping one’s lips buttoned is the best
thing to do when someone is angry.”
“Exactly! So, how are things at your
ofce? Heard you’re getting a new boss.”
“That’s true. He’ll be joining us in a
week or two.”
“That’s a long time! What are you guys
going to be doing?”
“What we’ve been doing the past few
days, I suppose! Sleepwalk through the
workday.”
“Sleepwalk through the day? What are
you talking about?”
“Do you know what sleepwalk means?”
“Doesn’t it mean to walk in one’s
sleep?”
“I’m told I used to sleepwalk when I
was a kid.”
“I believe my uncle sleepwalks even
now.”
“Sleepwalk has other meanings as well.
It’s frequently used in informal contexts
to mean to say something without really
thinking.”
“And you’re not thinking because
you’re asleep! Since your mind is not
functioning or has been switched of,
you’re not really worried about the
consequences of what you do or say.”
“Very good!”
“How about this example? Last night, I
saw a movie where most of the actors
sleepwalked through their roles.”
“So, what you’re suggesting is that the
actors were wooden. There was little or
no life in their acting.”
“Yes.”

The story so far:
T
he European Commission is
working on an age verifcation
app that is meant to stop
children from accessing unsafe
content online while protecting the
privacy of adult internet users. Critics,
however, claim this comes at the cost of
user privacy.
What is the European Commission
age verifcation debate?
The European Union has, in the recent
past, enacted multiple pieces of
legislation to regulate the operations of
large online platforms such as
e-commerce giants, social media
companies, and even
pornography-hosting websites. In
particular, the European Commission has
highlighted some risks that children face
when they are online, including platform
designs that encourage digital addiction,
cyberbullying, exposure to harmful
content, and unwanted contact from
strangers.
Digital advocates have previously
recommended that the user interface of a
large digital platform could be adjusted
on the basis of the user’s age, with
children receiving private accounts and
having their safety or well-being features
turned on by default. When it comes to
platforms such as porn sites, children
ideally should not be able to access or
even accidentally see explicit content.
One way this could be done is through an
app that verifes the user’s age online, in
order to be certain that children are not
using adults’ accounts.
The European Commission on July 14
presented guidelines concerning the
protection of minors on online platforms,
along with a prototype of an
age-verifcation app under the Digital
Services Act (DSA). Development of the
age verifcation blueprint began early this
year and is built on the same technical
specifcations as the European Digital
Identity Wallets (eID), which are slated to
be rolled out before the end of 2026,
according to the European Commission,
with two services meant to be
compatible.
Denmark, Greece, Spain, France, and
Italy are some of the frst countries that
will work alongside the Commission with
the aim of launching their own national
age verifcation apps in the future, in their
own languages.
“During the pilot phase, the age
verifcation solution will be further
enhanced with new features. Apart from
eID, further updates will include
additional options for users to prove they
are over 18. The age verifcation will also
be enhanced with the latest technical
solutions (zero-knowledge proof) to
ensure the highest level of privacy
protection,” said the European
Commission in its post.
How will age verifcation afect the
privacy of adults?
While those in favour of creating a safer
internet for children are in support of
making age verifcation mandatory to
access porn websites, critics of the move
believe that it violates privacy rights and
can put their security online at risk or
make their browsing activities easier to
track and monetise.
However, the European Commission
has defended the privacy standards of its
prototype app and said that it will enable
age verifcation while preventing privacy
violations. The regulator added that the
technical specifcations and the
open-source age verifcation blueprint
were freely available to view and use as
well.
“It will, for example, allow users to
easily prove they are over 18 when
accessing restricted adult content online,
while remaining in full control of any
other personal information, such as a
user’s exact age or identity. No one would
be able to track, see, or reconstruct what
content individual users are consulting,”
stated the Commission.
Meanwhile, at the topmost levels of the
French government, President Emmanuel
Macron also supports age verifcation and
even wants to ban social media for users
who are under 15 years of age.
France is one of the countries that will
frst try out the age verifcation app
prototype.
There are also ongoing discussions as
to whether certain social media platforms
that contain adult content, such as X, can
be classifed as porn platforms. This also
has implications for the user experience
of adult social media users across the
European Union.
Why are some porn companies
against age verifcation?
While most companies agree that
children using the internet should be
protected from explicit content,
cybersecurity threats, and social media
addiction, they often disagree on the ideal
way to go about this process.
For example, Pornhub-owner Aylo’s
main contention is whether age
verifcation takes place at the website
level or not. In a company post on June
26, Aylo stressed the need for
“device-based age verifcation.” According
to the company, age verifcation should
have been carried out by Apple, Google,
and/or Microsoft long before an underage
user even arrives at an adult website such
as Pornhub.
For close to two weeks in June, internet
users in France who tried to access
pornography platforms such as Pornhub,
YouPorn, and RedTube encountered a
largely black screen with a notice, or a
historic painting with a call to action
against the French government’s move to
implement mandatory age verifcation for
adult platforms.
Aylo also warned that users unable to
access Pornhub would go to smaller, less
regulated sites potentially hosting illegal
content. It unblocked its websites in late
June after a Paris administrative tribunal’s
decision over the rule’s unconfrmed
compatibility with EU laws. But Aylo’s
next actions remain to be seen as the top
administrative court afrmed this month
that age verifcation was a must.
“Data breaches happen daily. Forcing
you to enter sensitive personal
information repeatedly creates an
unacceptable security risk we refuse to
impose on our users. We refuse to
compromise your privacy with measures
that, ironically, fail to efectively protect
children,” said Aylo in a statement on its
website on July 15.
“To make the internet safer for
everyone, every phone, tablet or
computer should start as a kid-safe
device. Only verifed adults should be
allowed to unlock access to
age-inappropriate content,” said the
company.
What is the European Commission’s age
check plan to keep children safe online?
European Commission is developing an age verifcation app under the Digital Services Act to prevent minors from accessing harmful online content

Union Parliamentary Af-
fairs Minister Kiren Rijiju
on Sunday said over 100
MPs had already signed a
notice to bring a motion in
Parliament for the remo-
val of Justice Yashwant
Varma of the Allahabad
High Court which is the
minimum
support
re-
quired for tabling the im-
peachment motion in the
Lok Sabha.
“The signature [exer-
cise] is under way and it
has crossed 100 already,”
Mr. Rijiju told pressper-
sons after the all-party
meeting. He said the Busi-
ness Advisory Committee
would decide when the
motion were to be moved.
A motion for a judge’s
removal has to be signed
by no fewer than 100 MPs
in the Lok Sabha and 50 in
the Rajya Sabha. The mo-
tion is likely to be tabled in
the Lower House.
Recommended removal
Wads of half-burnt curren-
cy notes were discovered
at the outhouse of the
then Delhi High Court
judge Justice Varma by
emergency service provid-
ers following a fre in
March. A committee of
three High Court judges
appointed by the then
Chief Justice of India, San-
jiv Khanna, before his re-
tirement
had
indicted
him. The former CJI had
referred the matter to Pre-
sident Droupadi Murmu
and Prime Minister Naren-
dra Modi, recommending
Justice Varma’s removal af-
ter he refused to resign.
Justice Varma, who was
subsequently repatriated
to the Allahabad High
Court and kept of judicial
work, had protested his in-
nocence and moved the
top court against the com-
mittee’s fndings.
Pending motion
On Saturday, Rajya Sabha
member John Brittas of
the Communist Party of
India (Marxist) and the
CPI’s P. Sandosh Kumar
had fagged the Opposi-
tion’s pending impeach-
ment motion against Jus-
tice Shekhar Yadav of the
Allahabad High Court for
his alleged communal re-
marks, saying it was a test
of Parliament’s commit-
ment to the constitutional
value of secularism.
Minimum support gained
to move for removal of
Justice Varma, says Rijiju

“In the next stage, China is willing to maintain
communication with India through diplomatic
and military channels, and in the spirit of equal
consultation and mutual and equal security,
further refne the border area management and
control rules and strengthen confdence-building
measures, so as to achieve sustainable peace and
tranquillity in the border areas,” Mr. Xu said.
“Resuming the pilgrimage for Indian pilgrims
to the sacred mountain and lake in [Tibet] is an
important initiative taken by China to improve re-
lations between the two countries,” the Chinese
Ambassador said.
“Currently, the government departments of
both China and India, as well as major airlines,
have done a lot of work for the resumption of di-
rect fights. We hope that direct fights between
the two countries will be launched as soon as pos-
sible,” he added.
‘No third party targeted’
While the Defence Minister had visited Beijing and
held bilateral talks, India had said that the SCO De-
fence Ministers meeting failed to fnd consensus
as one country — referring to Pakistan — had held
up the language on terrorism in a proposed joint
statement. The Chinese Ambassador did not res-
pond to a specifc query about why the SCO had
not included India’s concerns over the Pahalgam
terror attack and cross-border terrorism in the
joint statement last month, pointing instead to an
SCO “code of conduct” that members could ex-
press their positions but “should avoid bringing
bilateral conficts” to discussions, in a reference to
India-Pakistan tensions.
Asked about the statement of India’s Deputy
Chief of the Army Staf, Lieutenant-General Rahul
R. Singh, about China’s support to Pakistan during
the four-day Operation Sindoor in May, Mr. Xu
said that China-Pakistan ties did not “target any
third party”. In his comments, Lieutenant-Gener-
al Singh had suggested that China had “used the
neighbour [Pakistan] to cause pain” to India, in
the manner of a “borrowed knife”.
“Defence and security cooperation is part of
the normal cooperation between China and Pakis-
tan,” Mr. Xu added, indicating that Mr. Jaishankar
and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had already
discussed the issue.
While side-stepping another question about
whether China’s trilaterals with other countries in
South Asia — including a recent China-Bangla-
desh-Pakistan initiative on trade, and a China-Pa-
kistan-Afghanistan initiative on infrastructure —
were a way of “cutting India out” of the SAARC re-
gion, Mr. Xu said that India was welcome to join
any of the initiatives, and hoped that China and In-
dia could create other trilateral partnerships with
countries in the region. He claimed that in the
past 12 years since the launch of China’s Belt and
Road Initiative, which India has refused to join,
trade between China and South Asian countries
“doubled from less than $100 billion to about
$200 billion”.
Dalai Lama succession
He said the issue of the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation
was an “internal matter” for China, and warned
that statements from India would be seen as “in-
terference”. During the celebrations for his 90th
birthday in Dharamshala earlier this month, the
14th Dalai Lama had announced that his successor
would be chosen by his ofce, not by China or any
other authority, a statement that was supported
by Minister for Minority Afairs Kiren Rijiju. Sub-
sequently, the Ministry of External Afairs had said
that the Indian government had “no position” and
makes “no statement” on the issue.
“We have noted the MEA of India’s response to
media queries regarding the statement by the 14th
Dalai Lama. However, it cannot be denied that
some ofcials of India openly expressed their wel-
come and support for the statement by the 14th
Dalai Lama, and attended his 90th birthday cele-
bration,” Mr. Xu said. “Such words and deeds are,
in essence, promoting interfering in China’s inter-
nal afairs using [Tibet]-related issues, contrary to
Indian government’s public stance,” he added.

The Minister made it clear that the fnal call on dis-
cussions in Parliament would be taken by the Bu-
siness Advisory Committees of the Lok Sabha and
the Rajya Sabha. The Houses of Parliament will
have 21 sittings during the session.
On the Opposition’s demand for Mr. Modi to
make a statement on the Pahalgam attack and oth-
er issues, Mr. Rijiju said: “I want to make it clear
that the Prime Minister remains in Parliament ex-
cept during foreign travel. The Prime Minister al-
ways remains in Parliament, but the Prime Minis-
ter does not remain in the House all the time.” He
said Cabinet Ministers were always present in
both Houses to respond to the issues concerning
their Ministries.
The Congress, however, maintained that it is
the Prime Minister’s moral responsibility to give a
statement in Parliament on key issues. “We hope
that the PM will fulfl his moral duty,” Congress
Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi
told presspersons. He warned that if the govern-
ment failed to answer the questions that had been
raised about the SIR, it would cast a doubt on the
fairness of the poll process and future elections.
Meanwhile, Opposition parties from southern
India sought clarity on the impending delimita-
tion exercise, saying that it had been causing con-
fusion among the electorate.

P
rime Minister Na-
rendra Modi will
embark on a two-
nation visit to the United
Kingdom and the Maldives
from July 23 to 26, the Ex-
ternal Afairs Ministry an-
nounced on Sunday.
During the visit to the
United
Kingdom,
the
Prime Minister is expected
to unveil the bilateral trade
agreement that was an-
nounced by both sides on
May 6.
“During the visit, Prime
Minister Modi will hold
wide-ranging discussions
with Prime Minister [Keir]
Starmer on the entire ga-
mut of India-U.K. bilateral
relations. They will also ex-
change views on issues of
regional and global impor-
tance,” the Ministry said in
a statement. The visit will
also include a meeting with
King Charles III.
Mr.
Modi
had
an-
nounced the trade deal on
May 6, describing it as
“ambitious and mutually
benefcial”. The announce-
ment followed a telephone
conversation
with
Mr.
Starmer.
Negotiations
for
the
agreement, which began in
2022, witnessed several
delays due to changes in
government in the U.K.
The British government
has described the agree-
ment as “the biggest and
most economically signif-
cant bilateral trade deal”.
Commerce and Indus-
try Minister Piyush Goyal
had visited the U.K. in June
to lay the groundwork for
the unveiling of the Free
Trade Agreement (FTA).
The visit will include a
review of the Comprehen-
sive Strategic Partnership
(CSP) between the two
countries, “with a specifc
focus on trade and econo-
my, technology and inno-
vation, defence and securi-
ty,
climate,
health,
education and people-to-
people ties,” the External
Afairs Ministry said.
Guest of Honour
Following the U.K. leg of
the tour, Mr. Modi will tra-
vel to the Maldives on July
25 at the invitation of Presi-
dent Mohamed Muizzu. He

Nepal Prime Minister K.P.
Sharma Oli will pay an of-

mid-September,
Nepal’s
Foreign Ministry said on
Sunday.
“Preparations for the

way. However, the date
and the detailed schedules
of the visit are yet to be f-

that Mr. Oli will embark on
his ofcial visit to the

Mr. Oli, the chairperson
of the Communist Party of
Nepal (Unifed Marxist-Le-

ofce of Prime Minister for
the fourth time last July.
He had chosen to visit
China for his maiden fo-

the frst destination after
assuming the post of Prime
Minister. Mr. Oli visited
China in December last
year at the invitation of his
Chinese counterpart Li
Qiang and met President Xi
Jinping.
‘Soured ties’
Amid speculation by some
sections of local media that
he didn’t receive any invi-
tation from India for an of-
fcial visit, indicating that
his relations with New Del-
hi had soured, Mr. Oli on
Thursday said he will be
visiting India and that
ground work is under way
on both sides for the trip.
He, however, did not
specify any timeframe for
the visit.

T
he 15-year-old girl
who sustained over
75% burns after be-
ing set ablaze by unidenti-
fed miscreants in Puri dis-
trict of Odisha on Saturday
was fown to the All India
Institute of Medical Scienc-
es (AIIMS) in New Delhi on
Sunday for advanced med-
ical treatment.
The decision to shift the
girl to the New Delhi hospi-
tal was taken after a team
of specialist doctors at the
AIIMS in Bhubaneswar ob-
served some improvement
in her condition. Notably,
despite
being
severely
traumatised both mentally
and physically, the girl was
able to speak.
On Saturday, Chief Mi-
nister Mohan Majhi had
said the State government
would provide air ambu-
lance support if doctors
deemed her ft for transfer.
A green corridor was
created between the AIIMS
and the Biju Patnaik Inter-
national Airport in Bhuba-
neswar to facilitate her
swift transfer on a life-sup-
port-equipped ambulance.
Additional forces had been
deployed. The girl was ac-
companied by two family
members and a team of
doctors on the aircraft.
‘Praying for recovery’
“I am deeply saddened by
the incident that took
place in Balanga, Puri dis-
trict. The victim has been
airlifted to Delhi AIIMS for
the best treatment. The
State government will en-
sure all necessary facilities
for this. I personally pray
to Lord Jagannath for the
speedy recovery of the
girl,” Mr. Majhi said on the
social media platform ‘X’.
The AIIMS, Bhubanes-
war, said a special bed and
a team of doctors had been
kept ready at the New Del-
hi institute for immediate
attention of the victim. The
State government also put
in a request for the crea-
tion of a green corridor in
New Delhi so that there
would not be any loss of
time in transferring the girl
to the premier medical
facility.
The girl was on her way
to her uncle’s house when
she was intercepted by
three individuals and ta-
ken to the bank of the
Bhargavi river, where she
was set on fre with an in-
fammable substance. A
man from a nearby house
came to her aid and man-
aged to douse the fames.
Police sources said eight
persons, including some
relatives of the victim,
were being questioned to
get any lead on the heinous
crime. Forensic teams vi-
sited the spot for the se-
cond time in search of
more clues.
‘Will take up issue’
Meanwhile, agitations by
Opposition political parties
continued across the State.
Biju Janata Dal (BJD) mem-
bers staged a demonstra-
tion outside the Balanga
police station in Puri.
At an all party meeting,
BJD Rajya Sabha member
Sasmit Patra said his party
would take up all issues,
especially the deteriorat-

in Odisha in light of the 15-
year-old girl being set on

BHUBANESWAR
Ahead of the Assembly
election in 2026, West Ben-
gal Chief Minister Mamata
Banerjee will on Monday
address the last Martyrs’
Day rally before the polls.
The rally is expected to
set the tone for the election
and discuss the political
road map. Identity politics
is likely to take centre stage
as the Trinamool Congress
has targeted the Bharatiya
Janta Party for attacks on
Bengali-speaking migrants
in BJP-ruled States.
The founding chairper-
son of the Trinamool Con-
gress will spotlight “Benga-
li pride” and address party
workers from across the
State at the annual meeting
in the heart of Kolkata at
the Esplanade crossing.
Brewing issue
Tensions have been brew-
ing in the State after re-
ports of repeated linguistic
profling of Bengali speak-
ing migrants in Odisha,
Maharashtra, Delhi, Guj-
rat, and Chhattisgarh.
Against this backdrop,
Ms. Banerjee, her nephew
and Trinamool’s second-
in-command, Abhishek Ba-
nerjee, and all prominent
party leaders took to the
streets on July 16, and said
protests would rage across
the country if Bengalis con-
tinued to be harassed.
Prime Minister Naren-
dra Modi addressed a polit-
ical rally in Durgapur on
July 18, and said that Ben-
gali language and identity
were paramount to the BJP.
“Wherever there is a BJP
government, Bengalis are
respected,
Bengali
lan-
guage is respected... We
will not allow this conspi-
racy against Bengali ashmi-
ta [identity and pride] to
succeed,” the Prime Minis-
ter said.
Notably, the issue of re-
gional Bengali identity and
pride had helped the Tri-
namool defeat the BJP in
the
2021
Assembly
election.
Ms. Banerjee also visited
the Martyrs’ Day rally site
on Sunday and inspected
the preparations a day
ahead of the main event.
Observed annually, the
Martyrs’ Day rally com-
memorates the police fr-
ing on July 21, 1993, that
left 13 youth activists dead.
Over the years, the event
has evolved into a show of
political strength and shar-
pening of political battle
lines.
The party supporters
have already started arriv-
ing in Kolkata and are ex-
pected to show up in huge
numbers on Monday. Tents
and camps have been set
up at a ground in Bidhan-
nagar for the party work-
ers for the day.

More than 27.4% Dalit vo-
ters in Bihar have “no
trust” in the Election Com-
mission (EC), a new survey
released ahead of the As-
sembly election in the
State has found. It also
shows that over 58% Sche-
duled Caste (SC) voters in
the State thought that un-
employment was the big-
gest issue in the upcoming
polls.
The survey was con-
ducted and released by the
National Confederation of
Dalit and Adivasi Associa-
tions (NACDAOR), a con-
glomerate of hundreds of
associations across the na-
tion. It covered a total of
18,581 SC voters from
across the State and was
conducted between June
10 and July 4, Ashok Bhar-
ti, Chairman of NACDAOR,
told The Hindu.
He added that since the
Election Commission start-
ed its special intensive revi-
sion of the rolls as the sur-
vey was under way, one
question was put on the
survey mid-way, for which
only around 8,500 res-
ponses could be gathered.
Fear of losing vote
To the question “Do you
fear losing your vote in the
new voter list?”, over 71%
of the respondents said
“yes” and 23.4% said “no”
with a little over 5% not ex-
pressing an opinion. On
the question of whether
they trusted the EC to be
impartial, over 27% said
“no”, about 51% said “yes”,
and 21% said they did not
know.
The survey asked a total
of 11 questions.
It found that while over
47.5% of the respondents
said Prime Minister Naren-
dra Modi was their favou-
rite leader at the national
level, 40.3% said Leader of
the Opposition in the Lok
Sabha Rahul Gandhi, and
about
12%
said
other
politicians.
It further said that to the
question “who do they cre-
dit for the caste census?”,
33.15% respondents said
Narendra Modi, 30.81% Ra-
hul Gandhi, 27.57% Bihar
Leader of the Opposition
Tejashwi Yadav, and about
8% other politicians.
Further,
the
survey
showed that about 48%
said the work of the Nitish
Kumar-led
government
was “bad”, while about
45% said it was good.
Mr. Bharti told The Hin-
du, “A lot of people do sur-
veys of Scheduled Castes,
but hardly do many of
them actually speak to us
on the ground. This survey
is of Dalits, by Dalits.”

Dharmas can be classifed into various types, such as San-
nyasa dharma, Sthree dharma, and Raja dharma. Sannya-
sa dharma is meant only for ascetics. Sthree dharma is on-
ly for women. Raja dharma refers to the specifc rules and
regulations that a king is expected to adhere to. These
dharmas are exclusive to each category. Sri. Muralidhara
Swamigal said in a discourse that Yudhishtra asked the
grandsire Bhishma whether there is any common dharma
that can be followed by all, irrespective of gender, caste,
creed, religion, or language. The grand sire replied that
there is a dharma called “Bhagavata Dharmam” which can
be adopted by all.
In the eleventh skandha (chapter) of Srimad Bhagava-
tam, it is elaborately explained what Bhagavata dharma is.
A king asks the Navayogis, “What should I do so that God
will be pleased and give Himself to me?” One of the Nava
yogis, Yogikavi, asks the king to follow Bhagavata dharma,
which implies chanting or calling the names of God. God
likes the Bhagavata dharma, as He introduced it to the
world so that people could reach Him.
It is rare to be born as a human being, and people can-
not aford to waste this opportunity. Saint Pattinathar says
life is like a pot flled with water, and if spilt, cannot be col-
lected and put back into the pot. We should approach an
Acharya and learn the dharma from him. People should
not attempt to do it themselves. It will be like a person
plucking a lotus from a pond in the evening and showing
the same before the Sun the next morning to blossom.
(Will it?) The grace of the Acharyas is like the water in a
pond, which helps our lives blossom.

M
ohammed
Suf-
yan,
25,
a
li-
censed
cattle
trader in Washim district
of Maharashtra, says he
was shocked when his buf-
faloes were detained by
“gau rakshaks (cow vigi-
lantes) with the help of the
local police” in May, while
being shifted from Badnera
in Amravati district to
Washim.
“I received a court order
and paid ₹65,000 as khava-
ti [maintenance payment
for animals in custody],
but I am yet to get my buf-
faloes back,” says Mr. Suf-
yan, adding that cow vigi-
lantes had obtained a stay
order, and a hearing is
scheduled in August. Mr.
Sufyan and his father are
licensed traders who buy
and sell cattle for a living.
“I may have to pay more
depending on how the Au-
gust 11 hearing goes. I can-
not even think of the loss I
have to bear. It makes no
sense to continue in this
business,” he said.
Mr. Sufyan is not in the
slaughter business, but
says he still faces the
squeeze. The situation is
worse for several other
members of the Muslim
Qureshi community deal-
ing in bufalo and other bo-
vine meat, be it traders or
butchers, who have alleg-
edly been harassed by cow
vigilante groups, including
members of the Bajrang
Dal. The harassment has
lasted for over a decade
now, they allege.
According to the Maha-
rashtra Animal Preserva-
tion (Amendment) Act,
2015, a ftness certifcate
from a veterinary doctor is
required for slaughtering
bufaloes, certifying that
the bufalo is “unft” for
milking and not pregnant.
However,
community
members say gau rakshak
groups “harass them” even
though they follow the law.
Condemning the violent
attacks on cattle and meat
traders and transporters,
and the heavy losses and
trauma caused by such at-
tacks, members of the Qu-
reshi
community
have
staged
protests
across
Maharashtra. They have al-
so announced an indefnite
boycott of cattle trade from
Monday. “Some of the
traders
have
already
stopped dealing in cattle;
however, formally, we are
launching a complete boy-
cott in Maharashtra from
July 21,” says Shabir Qu-
reshi of the All India Jamia-
tul Quresh (AIJQ), a trad-
ers’ union.
A delegation of the trad-
ers’ body also met Minister
of State for Home (Urban)
Yogesh Kadam and Direc-
tor-General of Police Rash-
mi Shukla, seeking protec-
tion
from
the
self-proclaimed gau raksh-
aks. “Both have given us
oral assurance that action
will be taken as per law,“
claims Abdul Sadiq Qu-
reshi, Vidharba chief of the
AIJQ.
In a letter to the DGP on
July 2, the AIJQ highlighted
“harassment” and “loss of
life and property” sufered
by those who transport
animals within Maharash-
tra and requested that
“police ofcers” in the res-
pective jurisdictions be di-
rected to remain “extra-vi-
gilant
and
control
harassment” of the com-
munity. The community al-
so says atrocities had in-
creased
after
the
Maharashtra Animal Pre-
servation Act, 1976 was
amended in March 2015,
prohibiting the slaughter
of cows, bulls, oxen, and
bullocks.
Citing the amended law,
AIJQ
president
Mo-
hammed Arif Chowdhary
said in the letter, “Under
Section 5A of the said Act,
there is no restriction for
transport of animals such
as goats, sheep, bufaloes
and other bovines within
the State, including for
purposes
of
being
butchered.”
Some of the Qureshi
community’s demands in-
clude protection for legal
animal traders; the prohi-
bition of illegal interfe-
rence and harassment; ac-
countability for inaction of
the police and administra-
tion; ensuring smooth op-
eration of slaughter hous-
es; and ending violence
against the community on
religious grounds.
“The boycott will im-
pact all farmers as they de-
pend on the Qureshi com-
munity to sell aged animals
and buy new ones,” says
Amravati-based
trader
Shaikh Afsar, adding buy-
ing and selling cattle is part
of the farming ecosystem.

The number of asset management
companies (AMC) have increased over
the years. This makes it difcult for
product diferentiation in the equity
space, as funds typically invest within
the universe of 500 stocks comprising
large-caps, mid-caps and small-caps.
It is, therefore, not surprising to see
AMCs creating diferent products to
woo investors. A diferentiating
product in recent times has been
multi-asset funds. Here, we discuss
the characteristics of such funds and if
they ft into your core portfolio.
Asset allocation
Asset allocation is the most important
step in the investment process. It
refers to the portion of savings you
invest in asset classes to achieve life
goals. Asset allocation can vary for
each goal, even if all the goals have the
same time horizon. Why? Asset
allocation is a function of risk attitude-
more important a goal is, less risk you
want to take; that means more bonds
and less equity allocation. For
instance, the asset allocation for your
child’s education portfolio may be
more conservative compared with
that of your retirement portfolio.
A multi-asset class fund could take
exposure to three asset classes —
equity, bonds and commodities
(typically gold and silver). You must
be mindful of having commodities in
the core portfolio, as prices are
volatile driven by global demand and
supply and geopolitical issues.
That apart, such a fund decides the
optimal allocation to each asset class
based on investment mandate. In
other words, the fund’s asset
allocation cannot be tailored to your
goals or risk attitude.
Conclusion
You must make tax-efcient
investments. Are multi-asset funds tax
efcient? A multi-asset fund that
invests more than 65% in equity is
considered an equity fund.
The point is that if you sell your
fund units after holding them for
more than 12 months, you must pay
12.5% long-term capital gains tax
above ₹1.25 lakh in any year you
realise the gains. But funds holding
less than 65% in equity are considered
as non-equity-oriented funds.
Capital gains arising from such
funds will be added to your total
income and taxed at your marginal
tax regardless of the holding period.
This has major implications on the
post-tax returns on your investments,
as the equity portion of the fund will
also be taxed at your marginal tax rate
(typically 30%). You must be mindful
of these factors when you choose
multi-asset funds.

programmes for individuals to manage
their personal investments)

Personal loan is often the preferred
credit option for those seeking quick
credit access with minimal
documentation and no collateral.
However, this ease of access leads
many borrowers to overlook crucial
aspects, leading to higher interest
costs, unexpected charges or even a
debt trap. Here are fve common
mistakes loan applicants should avoid:
Not getting credit report early
Your credit score is one of the frst
flters lenders would use to evaluate
creditworthiness. Those with higher
credit scores usually have better
chances of loan approval. Many
lenders also use credit scores to set
interest rates of the loan applicants,
with those having higher scores being
ofered lower rates for the loans.
Thus, always fetch your credit report
before making the loan application as
any error or outdated information in
credit report can reduce credit score
and thereby, reduce loan approval
chances. If you notice any error(s),
report them to the concerned credit
bureau(s) and the lender for
rectifcation. A rectifed credit report
can lead to higher credit score and
thereby, increase your loan approval
chances at lower interest rates.
Not comparing loan ofers
The interest rates ofered to the
same applicant can vary widely across
lenders depending on cost of funds
and credit risk assessment of the loan
applicant. Some lenders also ofer
loans at preferential interest rates to
existing customers. Thus, those
planning to avail the loans should
compare loan ofers from as many
lenders as possible.
They should begin the search by
approaching banks and NBFCs with
which they already have existing
deposit and/or loan/credit card
relationships. This should be followed
by visiting online fnancial
marketplaces to view the loan options
of other lenders.
Then, an applicant should opt for
the lender that charges the lowest
interest rate for the desired loan
amount with the optimal tenure.
Ignoring ‘optimal’ repayment
Lenders usually prefer loan
applicants whose monthly EMI
obligations, including that of the
proposed loan, do not exceed 50-60%
of the monthly income. However,
even if it does not, the optimal loan
EMI would be the one on which you
incur the lowest interest cost without
adversely impacting unavoidable
expenses and monthly contributions
for crucial fnancial goals. You should
use online EMI calculators to fx the
optimal loan EMI after factoring in
income/other fnancial commitments.
Ignoring loan options
Just like personal loans, secured
loan options like top-up home loans,
loan against property (LAP), gold
loans and loan against securities do
not have any end-usage restrictions.
Being secured in nature, these
loans usually have lower interest rates
than personal loans. Top-up home
loans and LAP also ofer longer
tenures than personal loans, which
further increases EMI afordability
and overall loan amount eligibility for
the borrowers.
On the fip side, the turnaround
time (TAT) for LAP disbursal can be
much higher than that of personal
loans, while gold loan and loan
against securities have similar TATs.
Thus, existing home loan
borrowers or those having adequate
gold, property or investments to
pledge should explore suitable
secured loan alternatives and
disbursal TAT before making a
personal loan application.
Ignoring emergency fund
Financial emergencies or loss of
income due to job loss, disability,
illness, etc. lead many borrowers to
default on EMIs. Such repayment
failures would not only incur hefty
penalties, it also reduces one’s credit
score and thereby, his or her future
loan/credit card eligibility. The best
way to avoid such scenarios is to
increase the size of your emergency
fund by at least six months’ worth of
your personal loan EMI.

I
f a child pesters his
father for money,
his
usual
retort
would be, “Do you
think I’m out there shaking
a money tree.”
Yes, in a way, he is right,
you can’t just pluck money
of a tree. But even a small
penny is like a seemingly
small seed, which when
nurtured and nourished
carefully, can be the begin-
ning of a forest.
Power of compounding
In the world of fnance,
there is one such seed,
which not only grows into
a tree but could become an
entire forest — the power of
compounding. The magic
of compounding is that it
starts small but grows ex-
ponentially over time.
More than two centuries
ago, Benjamin Franklin,
the frst Postmaster-Gener-
al of the United States and
author of the book Poor Ri-
chard’s Almanack, echoed
this concept saying, “Mo-
ney makes money. “And
the money that money
makes, makes money.”
Further, highlighting its
potential of exponential
wealth creation in the long
run, famous physicist Al-
bert Einstein said, “com-
pound
interest
is
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world.”
Though the phrase “the
compound efect” existed
for aeons, especially in
mathematics, it became
quite popular in the realm
of fnance, productivity
and personal development
after a bestselling book by
U.S. author Darren Hardy.
Compound efect
The compound efect is
like a snowballing efect
wherein a small, consistent
action or an investment ac-
cumulates over a period,
leading to an exponential
growth. In personal f-
nance, it refers to the pro-
cess wherein your initial
invested money earns in-
terest, and the interest
earned
earns
interest,
which subsequently gener-
ates interest, and the chain
goes on and on.
This way, you make a gi-
gantic leap from your origi-
nal invested amount. Not
just this, the beauty of the
compound efect is that
you need not work hard for
it, as even if you are sleep-
ing, your invested money
will silently work and keep
on generating money for
you.
You need to give time
for it and just be patient.
Consistency is the key.
Let’s imagine this scena-
rio. God wishes to give a
boon and places two choic-
es before you. First – He
will clear all your debts in-
stantly, say ₹35,00,000.
Second – He will give
you ₹1 on the frst day with
a promise that it will dou-
ble every day for one
month. So, which one do
you choose?
Almost all 10 people
would only choose the frst
option for two reasons.
The frst being instant grat-
ifcation and the second is
the lack of awareness of
compounding efects.
In contrast, mathemati-
cians or fnancial experts
will only choose the se-
cond option of taking the
₹1 that doubles every day
for 30 days. They do not
mind waiting for 30 days,
let’s fnd out why.
Money doubles
On day one, God gives you
₹1, it doubles to ₹2 on the
second day, to ₹4 on the
third day. Likewise, it dou-
bles to ₹512 on the 10th
day. Your patience is being
tested here.
In a similar doubling
strategy, your money be-
comes ₹16,384 on the 15th
day. Time is the secret;
time begets money.
On day 20, it would be
₹5,24,288, which is way
less from the frst choice.
But wait, we have 10 more
days. On day 24, it would
have
doubled
to
₹83,88,608 and on the last
day,
it
would
be
₹53,68,70,912.
In just 30 days, ₹1 trans-
forms into a whopping
sum of more than ₹53
crore. You call it mind
blowing but that’s the pow-
er of compounding.
SIP investment
Now, let’s take a real-life ex-
ample.
Priya
invests
₹1,000 every month in a
Systematic
Investment
Plan (SIP) that gives her
12% Compound Annual
Growth Rate (CAGR).
After fve years, her in-
vestment
would
have
grown to almost ₹82,000.
After 10 years, it becomes
₹2,32,000 (approximately)
and
after
20
years
₹9,99,000.
But wait, the magic has
not happened yet. In 30
years,
it
becomes
₹35,29,000 and in 40
years, a whopping sum of
more than a ₹1 crore.
So, just a ₹1,000 in
monthly SIP transforms in-
to more than a ₹1 crore in
40 years.
That’s the reason all f-
nancial experts advise us
to start saving right from
the frst salary, so that, by
the time you retire, you
would have saved enough,
and your money would
have worked for you even
when you were sleeping.
If you need more mo-
ney, just step up your SIP
amount of ₹1,000 per
month by just 10% every
year, witness the magic
and enjoy your retirement
life comfortably and wor-
ry-free. Start saving early.

UP THE HILL
AP
Fast bowler Anshul Kam-
boj has been added to In-
dia’s squad ahead of the
fourth Test against En-
gland as a cover for Arsh-
deep Singh, who sufered a
cut in his bowling hand
during a training session in
Beckenham earlier this
week.
With Arshdeep unlikely
to recover in time for the
Manchester Test, which
begins on Wednesday, the
national selection commit-
tee has decided to add the
young fast bowler from Ha-
ryana as a back-up option
for the remainder of the
series.
After a successful dom-
estic season, where he
claimed 79 wickets in 24
games for Haryana, Kam-
boj had a fruitful stint with
India-A during its two
three-day
match
series
against England Lions. As
he claimed fve wickets in
two games, the selectors
were impressed with his
performance.
With Arshdeep likely to
take another 10 days to re-
cover and Akash Deep
picking up a groin niggle, it
would be interesting to see
if Kamboj, who linked up
with the squad on Sunday,
is eventually drafted into
India’s playing XI.
Nitish sufers injury
Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar
Reddy is in danger of being
ruled out of the remainder
of the Anderson-Tendulkar
Trophy after picking up a
knee injury while training
at the gym.
The Hindu understands
that the all-rounder under-
went scans, which re-
vealed ligament damage,
and the BCCI medical team
is currently monitoring the
situation before making a
decision about his future.
Nitish skipped the team’s
visit to Manchester United
FC, and also could not be
spotted in the closed-door
optional practice session.
India now fnds itself in
a spot of bother ahead of
the crucial Test, and the
availability of Jasprit Bum-
rah becomes even more
critical. Among the pacers,
Mohammed Siraj is the on-
ly one to have played all
three Tests in this series
and has bowled the most
overs for the tourists. With
still a couple of matches to
go, the team management
needs to manage Siraj’s
workload carefully.
Pacer Kamboj added
as cover to India squad
It remains to be seen whether
Kamboj will be drafted into
India’s playing XI.

INDIA IN ENGLAND
D
hruv
Jurel
isn’t
quite expressive.
He is calm, though
not often quiet. He comes
with a positive mindset,
and is always ready to put
in the hard yards.
The son of an army
man, he focuses on ‘pro-
cess’
and
‘discipline’.
Those two words, he be-
lieves, have helped him
grow as a cricketer. In a
competitive environment,
where opportunity doesn’t
come easy, long waits may
often make or break ca-
reers, and for Jurel, it has
been a long eight-month
wait since his last Test out-
ing in Perth last November.
But the 24-year-old has
taken it in his stride.
Ever since landing in En-
gland a couple of months
ago, Jurel featured in just
two games for India-A,
where he scored 227 runs
in
four
innings
and
claimed seven catches. But
in the senior team, Jurel
has been under the sha-
dow of Rishabh Pant, the
team’s vice-captain and
the
frst-choice
wicketkeeper-batter.
While Pant featured in
all three Tests in the series
so far, Jurel worked closely
with felding coach T. Dilip
and batting coach Sitanshu
Kotak over the last several
weeks to make sure he re-
mains ft and in the groove.
When India had a long
session at Beckenham ear-
lier this week, Jurel was
among the frst few batters
to have a long session in
the nets. As bowling coach
Morne Morkel aimed at Ju-
rel’s stumps to test his out-
side edge, the youngster
remained
unperturbed
and
looked
confdent
throughout.
And as India gears up
for the must-win fourth
Test at Old Traford, India’s
assistant coach Ryan ten
Doeschate indicated that if
Pant, who hurt his left in-
dex fnger during the
Lord’s Test, isn’t ready to
keep the wickets, India
could look at Jurel.
In that case, Pant could
be used as a specialist bat-
ter. Jurel, being a steady
middle-order batter, could
also add depth to the bat-
ting department.
However, if both Jurel
and Pant end up playing
together, it would be a se-
lection headache for the
team management. But
sources indicated that Pant
will be monitored over the
next couple of days before
taking a call.
“We don’t want to go
through that again where
we have to replace the
keeper halfway through in
the innings. We are just try-
ing to give (Pant’s fnger) as
long as possible (to heal),
and hopefully he’s good to
go in Manchester in the
frst
training
session,”
Doeschate said, adding:
“Jurel is in the equation.”
In the previous Test, Ju-
rel came in as Pant’s substi-
tute after the latter hurt his
fnger, and ended up con-
ceding 25 byes in the se-
cond innings, as India
went down by 22 runs to
concede a 1-2 lead in the
fve-match series.
But it’s not just Jurel,
several
wicket-keepers
have struggled in England
where the ball wobbles a
lot once it goes past the
batter.
Despite earning praise
from the cricketing frater-
nity, it has still been a long
wait for Jurel. But now,
with the series on the line
and the team management
not willing to risk Pant, he
could just get lucky.

First-choice wicketkeeper Pant, who is nursing a fnger injury, may feature as a specialist batter
in the fourth Test; he will be monitored over the next couple of days before taking a call
Slow over-rates and fre-
quent ball changes have
been the major talking
points of the Anderson-
Tendulkar Trophy so far.
Indian all-rounder Ravin-
dra Jadeja also drew fak
for allegedly ignoring the
umpire’s message to get on
with the game when he
was having a drink bet-
ween overs during the
third Test at Lord’s.
As
several
former
cricketers, including form-
er England captain Mi-
chael Atherton, criticised
the umpires for losing
their grip on the game, le-
gendary umpire Dickie
Bird believes that it’s im-
portant for the match of-
cials to be strong and en-
sure that they have the last
word on the feld.
“The spectators pay a
lot of money to watch Test
matches nowadays. Too
many stoppages is not
good for Test cricket as it
loses interest and that’s
where the umpires need to
be strong and tell the
players that they should
get going and such stop-
pages won’t be tolerated,”
Bird told The Hindu.
The 92-year-old, who
has followed the series
closely, believes the DRS
has diminished the author-
ity of the umpires slightly.
“Now, I see they are chang-
ing the ball every now and
then, and that automati-
cally
slows
down
the
game, but the umpires
should make sure that they
don’t allow unnecessary
breaks as it kills the buzz,”
he said.
“In my time, I would
jokingly tell the players,
‘come on, lads, get on with
the game, let’s not kill the
(charm) of the game.’ We
would have a good laugh
and I ensured that we were
back in action as quickly as
possible,” Bird, who of-
ciated in 66 Tests and 69
ODIs, said, adding: “My
era also had some great
characters, but we still got
going without (much trou-
ble).”
‘Umpires should
ensure there are no
unnecessary breaks’
Bird oficiated in 66 Tests and
69 ODIs. SHAYAN ACHARYA

the pool matches, Railways
peaked when it mattered
most: in the knockouts.
It was a lesson in spot-
ting the weakness of the
opponent and working out
a plan and executing it to a
T.
Realising that the Navy
players are excellent in de-
fections through long and
short passes from the 25-
yard, dotted lines and the
striking circle, Railways
seldom allowed the rival
strikers any leeway to un-
leash their shots. Such was
the efectiveness of the
Railways defence.
In all the four quarters,
Railways held the upper
hand,
negating
Navy’s
counter-attacks with ease.
Eight minutes into the
contest, Railways scored
through Shivam Anand
who scooped one to the
roof of the net after receiv-
ing the pass from Gursa-
hibjit Singh from the left. It
could have been 2-0 for
Railways towards the end
of frst quarter if not for Za-
meer, being the last man
standing behind ’keeper
Sanjay Bhaskar, blocking a
shot by Sayyad Niyaz Ra-
him.
Within minutes, Navy
equalised through Aakib
Rahim Arif who slotted it
home from the top of the
circle.
Thereafter, it was Rail-
ways’ show all the way.
Pankaj Rawat converted a
copy-book penalty corner
shot in the third quarter
and Niyaz Rahim’s ferce
hit from the circle in the
57th
minute
made
it
beyond the reach of Navy.
Sunil Kumar Singh, who
was the head coach of Rail-
ways for three straight
time, was ecstatic. “It’s a
huge achievement for us to
have a hat-trick in such a
big tournament. We im-
proved after each match.
We knew the opponent
will be depending on the
slap shot. We only had to
make sure we block it once
they enter the 25-yard,”
said Sunil.
Railways received Rs. 7
lakh while Navy had to be
content with Rs. 5 lakh.
M.
M.
Murugappan,
chairman, CUMI and Chola
MS, gave away the prizes.
The result (ﬁnal): Indian
Railways 3 (Shivam Anand 8,
Pankaj Rawat 37, Sayyad Niyaz
Rahim 57) bt Navy 1 (Aakib Rahim
Arif 15).

Sreeshankar
opened
with a 7.63m jump, fol-
lowed it up with his win-
ning leap of 7.75m in the se-
cond round, and then
recorded a solid 7.69m. His
third attempt was a foul,
while his fnal two jumps
were measured at 6.12m
and 7.58m.
Poland’s Piotr Tarkow-
ski matched Sreeshankar’s
7.75m efort but his second
best jump — 7.58m — was

THE HINDU
I
Monday, July 21, 2025
Delhi
Sport
U
ntil a fortnight ago, India hadn’t
won a Test match at Edgbaston.
Shubman Gill’s men created
history in Birmingham with
their commanding 336-run win in the
second Test, correcting one anomaly. This
week, they will get a chance to set
another record straight at Old Traford, a
ground where nine previous Tests have
failed to yield a victory.
For various reasons, India have played
a mere two Tests in Manchester in the
preceding 35 years, the last of them 11
years ago. They were scheduled to play
the ffth and fnal Test here in 2021 until
the outbreak of Covid-19 in the ranks and
the fear of what it might lead to forced
Virat Kohli’s men to fy out to Dubai
holding a 2-1 lead. When India returned 12
months later, the Test was moved to
Birmingham. By then, Rohit Sharma had
replaced Kohli as the all-format captain
but couldn’t play the ‘decider’ due to
Covid. In his frst Test as stand-in skipper,
Jasprit Bumrah oversaw a crushing
seven-wicket loss with England hunting
down a target of 378 with consummate
ease, thanks to centuries from Joe Root
and Jonny Bairstow as the hosts provided
an early example of the ‘Bazball’ style of
play that has since become their USP.
The worst of India’s four losses dates to
July 1952 when Vijay Hazare’s side was
battered by an innings and 207 runs by an
English outft under Len Hutton. The
skipper’s century headlined an England
tally of 347 for nine declared, after which
India had two disastrous outings with the
bat. In the frst innings, with the fery
Fred Trueman (8/31) scything through
their line-up, the visitors were shot out for
58 – a dubious record that went out the
window in 1974 when Ajit Wadekar and
his men were skittled for 42 at Lord’s by
Chris Old and Geof Arnold. In the second
innings, Alec Bedser and Tony Lock
complemented Trueman by sharing nine
wickets, India collapsing in a heap for 82
with Hemu Adhikari’s 27 the highest score
by an Indian across the two innings. In all,
the double-fgure mark was breached just
fve times and there were six ducks.
India’s last Test here was in August
2014, marked by further forgettable
batting displays that netted them 152 and
161, which ensured that England’s 367 was
enough to drive them to an
innings-and-54-run win. That was the
series during which Kohli struggled to buy
a run, aggregating just 134 in ten innings
with a combination of James Anderson
and the corridor of uncertainty his
perennial bugbear. Kohli perished to the
English swing king for 0 and 7, his travails
mirroring that of his team’s as they
crashed and burned to a 1-3 hammering.
Big disappointment
The captain during that unedifying
campaign was Mahendra Singh Dhoni,
who was also at the helm when India
wiped the foor 0-4 on the preceding tour
in 2011 despite Rahul Dravid amassing 461
runs, studded by three centuries. That
was just a few months before Dhoni
abruptly announced his retirement from
Test cricket during the tour of Australia
over the winter, though the innings loss to
Alastair Cook’s men in 2014 wouldn’t be
the Jharkhandi’s Old Traford swansong.
Dhoni returned to Manchester for the
2019 50-over World Cup, making 1 and an
unbeaten 56 in comfortable league wins
over Pakistan and West Indies
respectively. Then came the big one, the
semifnal against New Zealand which
spilled over to the reserve day.
When rain halted proceedings on the
original match day (July 9), the Kiwis had
laboured to 211 for fve with Ross Taylor
and Tom Latham holding fort. India’s
batting had been in roaring form
throughout the tournament, propelled by
an unprecedented fve centuries in a
single World Cup by Rohit Sharma. There
was belief within the camp that even if
New Zealand posted 250, they had the
resources to overhaul that total – the
depth in the batting was illustrated by
Ravindra Jadeja’s presence at No. 8.
At breakfast on the reserve day,
Rishabh Pant – interestingly, one of four
stumpers in that XI alongside Dhoni, K.L.
Rahul and Dinesh Karthik – sought to
know Dhoni’s plans for the trip to
London, ostensibly for the fnal. Some of
the players intended to make the most of
the early fnish on the reserve day to drive
individually to the English capital. Dhoni
is supposed to have told his
successor-in-waiting that he’d rather
travel by the team bus ‘one last time’, the
earliest indication that he was done with
international cricket. As it transpired, it
wouldn’t be another 13 months until he'd
formally announce his retirement through
social media.
New Zealand scrambled to 239 for
eight on the reserve day when they ran
out of time, setting their opponents a
challenging target magnifed by the
overhead conditions that were exactly
what Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie
Ferguson were praying for. In no time, the
cream of the Indian batting, including
Rohit and Kohli, were back in the hutch.
At 24 for four in 10 overs with Henry
breathing fre (he took three of those four
wickets), India needed their famed depth
to bail them out even if the odds were
seriously stacked against them.
Pant and Hardik Pandya ground out 32
apiece but when the left-arm spinner
Mitchell Santner accounted for the latter,
India were all but out for the count, 92 for
six after 30.3 overs. Jadeja’s arrival at the
crease brought the last recognised pair
together, India needing 148 at more than
seven over. Then began an extraordinary
counter-attack with Jadeja in the
forefront. Where Dhoni was content to
play second fddle and bide his time, the
left-hander from Saurashtra cut loose
uninhibitedly. There were four fours and
as many sixes in his 59-ball 77 which
easily dominated the seventh-wicket
stand of 116.
The duo had brought the equation
down to 32 of 20 when, against the run
of play, Jadeja was foxed by a Boult slower
delivery and holed out to Kane
Williamson, the calmest man on the park.
But Dhoni was still around and when
Dhoni’s around, there is still hope, isn’t
there? It was during this year’s IPL, when
Dhoni was 43; how could it not have been
there when he was 37, no longer at his
peak but still a fearsome force of nature?
Thirty-one were required of the last
two overs when Ferguson fronted up for
the 49th. Boult, Henry and Santner had
all bowled out, Jimmy Neesham would
bowl the last over. Dhoni was the master
of taking it to the last over and everyone
at the ground, all Kiwis included, believed
Dhoni would mentally and
psychologically stare Neesham down even
if 20 were needed of the fnal six
deliveries. It was a question of not getting
out to Ferguson; instead, Dhoni went
airborne as he scythed the frst ball over
point for six, after which he patted a
yorker back to the bowler.
The third ball was short, banged into
the pitch from wide of the crease, the line
impeccable. Dhoni could only bunt it
behind square, but he saw an opportunity
to come back for the second. He did come
back for the second, but fell fractionally
short as an extraordinary direct hit,
of-balance, from Martin Guptill charging
in from the boundary shattered the
stumps at the striker’s end. It also
shattered Indian hopes and aspirations.
Dhoni was run out for an even 50 but no
one cared, not least the protagonist
himself. There was no applause for a
half-century, just the deafening sound of
silence while the Kiwis celebrated with
gusto. If there was one moment that
encapsulated India’s Old Traford travails,
it was that.
Happy memories of the cricket ground
that lies just half a mile across from the
largest Premiership football stadium of
the same name are few and far between,
so why not refect on potentially the most
far-reaching of the lot, the frst of an
incredible 51 Test centuries by the little
big man of Indian cricket? Sachin
Tendulkar had been dismissed for 88 in
Napier in February 1990, caught by future
India coach John Wright of Danny
Morrison. Had he reached three-fgures,
he would have become the youngest Test
centurion at the time.
Tendulkar wasn’t to be denied his
maiden tryst with a hundred six months
later. India were in a scrap for survival on
the last day of the second Test, stumbling
to 183 for six after being set 408 for
victory. All the big guns – Ravi Shastri,
Navjot Singh, Sanjay Manjrekar, Dilip
Vengsarkar, skipper Mohammad
Azharuddin and Kapil Dev – had come
and gone, and only Kiran More and
leggies Anil Kumble and Narendra
Hirwani were to come when Tendulkar,
batting at No. 6, was joined by No. 8
Manoj Prabhakar. England had nearly two
and a half hours to winkle out the last
four wickets and they believed if they split
this alliance, the end would only be a few
deliveries away.
The 17-year-old Tendulkar was in the
early 20s at Prabhakar’s arrival. He had
shown glimpses of his genius in the frst
innings with a polished 68 that convinced
the English that he was the real deal. But
the second innings was a diferent kettle
of fsh.
The target was beyond India’s reach,
their only hope was to grind out a draw
but against Devon Malcolm, Angus Fraser,
Chris Lewis and veteran of-spinner Eddie
Hemmings, that was easier said than
done. Despite his tender age and his lack
of experience – it was just his ninth Test –
Tendulkar instinctively knew that going
into a shell was fraught with danger. And
so he played his shots, not recklessly or
on a song and a prayer, but with
assurance and control with a stoic
Prabhakar for company. A pushed three
to long-of catapulted him past hundred,
the thunderous ovation just the frst of
thousands that would accompany him till
his last day as an international cricketer.
Not quite ‘Sa-chin, Saaaa-chin’, though
there’s no prizes for guessing where the
genesis of that chant lies.
Tryst with history as India seeks to
break Old Traford jinx
Shubman Gill’s men, who broke their duck at Edgbaston in the second Test against England, have an onerous task ahead of them; the ground where the Men in Blue sufered
a heartbreaking loss in the 2019 World Cup semifnal was also the venue where Tendulkar scored his maiden Test hundred in a match-saving efort 35 years ago

BIG SHOT
A
fter a long day at work, it’s
easier to fop on the couch than
hit the gym. Scrolling over
social media wins over reading
a book. Our exhausted brains favour
easier tasks, even if — according to a new
study in the Journal of Neuroscience —
those tasks ofer fewer benefts.
Even sedentary work can feel
exhausting when sustained for hours
together. This exhaustion is called
cognitive fatigue and builds up with
continuous efort to maintain focus on
daily tasks. While cognitive fatigue afects
our performance and focus, the new
study has found that it also infuences
decision-making by making one prefer
easier tasks.
“Everybody has diferent capacities for
work,” Vikram Chib of the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine and the lead author of
the study said. “We all have a subjective
sense of efort — what you may fnd easy, I
might fnd difcult.” The study also
provides a neurobiological model to
explore how fatigue can infuence
everyday decisions.
‘Really cool’
But frst, how does sustained efort build
up to cognitive fatigue, and how does it
afect decisions about exerting further
efort?
To answer these questions, researchers
recruited healthy volunteers to repeatedly
perform a working memory task. These
individuals focused on a screen fashing
diferent letters one by one. In the easy
version of the task, they had to recall if
the current letter matched the preceding
one. As the task got harder, volunteers
had to recall if the current letter matched
with those displayed anywhere between
two to six letters prior. After performing
the harder tasks many times in a row,
participants reported feeling fatigued.
Next, the participants were ofered two
choices: easy version of the task for less
money or difcult version of the task for
more money. Fatigued participants chose
the easy option even if it meant earning
less money, whereas they opted for
harder tasks for more money when they
were rested.
“It was really cool to see something we
expected but was never quantifed before,
that fatigue actually infuenced the
participants’ choices,” Dr. Chib said.
While the participants made their
choices, the researchers tracked their
brain activity using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). This
noninvasive technique allows scientists to
pinpoint brain regions that are active
during a task. As participants performed
the working memory task and reported
feeling fatigued, fMRI revealed the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC),
located just behind the forehead, was
activated, in line with its understood role.
fMRI scans also revealed the right
anterior insula was active when the
participants made their choices. This
region judges whether the efort required
for a task is worth the reward. In previous
studies from Dr. Chib’s group, the insula
had been found to estimate the efort of
performing a physical task while
physically fatigued.
Pushing harder
In this study, the role of the insula was
extended to evaluating cognitive efort.
“This is our current working model of
where efort is evaluated in the brain. The
insula receives input of fatigue resulting
from working memory tasks from the
dlPFC and of fatigue resulting from
physical tasks from the motor cortex, and
it guides decisions about future efort
based on the level of fatigue,” Dr. Chib
explained.
“A big strength of this study is that it
fnds connectivity linking exertion to
choice,” Antonius Wiehler, a researcher
studying motivation and cognitive fatigue
at the Paris Brain Institute, said. Indeed,
Dr. Chib and his team found that signals
from the dlPFC representing fatigue
infuenced the neural activity of the
insula. This meant fatigue directly
changed the value of efort, making the
task seem more demanding than when a
person was rested.
The researchers also reported a
peculiar observation: while participants
reported feeling fatigued as they
performed the hard tasks repeatedly,
their performance didn’t dip. The
researchers interpreted this to mean that
as people performed harder tasks, the
fatigue made them pick easier tasks rather
than compromise their performance.
Dr. Wiehler, who wasn’t part of the
study, agreed: “When the stakes are high
and the benefts are clear, such as in this
study, people can still use cognitive
resources despite needing elevated efort.
However, when benefts are uncertain or
subjective, like in market decisions, the
increased cost leads to behavioural
changes.”
We have all experienced this in our
daily lives: when a deadline looms, we
push ourselves harder to fnish a task at
hand despite needing more efort.
The study also opens new questions.
Dr. Wiehler, who induces cognitive fatigue
on much longer time scales (up to six
hours) in his research, wondered, “How
are short-term and long-term fatigue
efects related? How are cognitive
capacities restored after a night of sleep?”
Can cognitive fatigue infuence
efort-based choices for any task? “We
have a new study coming up where we
report that cognitive fatigue, as induced
here with the working memory tasks,
makes participants choose even a
physical task requiring less efort,” Dr.
Chib said.In other words, there may be a
neurobiological reason to avoid the gym
when one is mentally exhausted.
Time for a break
Cognitive fatigue is a common symptom
of many neurological and psychiatric
conditions. Patients who have sufered
stroke and those sufering from multiple
sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome,
depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia
have reported mental fatigue. Yet the way
fatigue manifests in these conditions is
poorly defned. The new study is a step
towards developing ways to manage
fatigue by understanding how it afects
efort and decision-making in the brain.
How can we avoid fatigue skewing our
daily decisions? Dr. Chib advised being
“mindful about taking breaks. While we
haven’t directly tested it, reframing tasks
can also help.” The next time you catch
yourself making a poor but easy choice
while mentally tired, you know it’s time
for a break.

International Moon Day
is celebrated every
year on July 20 to
commemorate
humankind’s ﬁrst
landing on the moon
by the Apollo 11
mission in 1969. The UN General
Assembly formally recognised this
date in 2021, following a proposal
recommended by the Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space
(COPUOS). The commemoration also
aims to highlight the collective
progress of all nations in exploring the
moon.
On the day, activities like public
events, sky-gazing, educational
outreach, and science competitions
are organised worldwide to inspire
curiosity and foster interest in space
science, especially among the youth.
According to the UN, International
Moon Day also serves to promote
sustainable practices in space,
international cooperation, peaceful
exploration, and the responsible use
of lunar resources.
There have been minor criticisms
related to the chosen date. Some
commentators have noted that while
the Apollo 11 lunar module landed on
July 20, Armstrong’s ﬁrst step
technically occurred at 2:56 UTC on
July 21. This ambiguity has
occasionally prompted debate over
whether July 21 is more accurate to
commemorate. There is also
occasional commentary questioning
whether the date, rooted in an American
achievement, fully encompasses the
international spirit intended by the UN,
more so since other nations have
contributed signiﬁcantly to lunar
exploration.
Despite these discussions, July 20 remains
globally recognised for now as the date
humankind ﬁrst leapt beyond the earth.
Moon Day: remembering the leap
